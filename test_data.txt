4	:	"Liked the ease of use and convenience.Least liked the bass quality, though very good could/should have been deeper/richer, or at least adjustable.Overall, very happy with them."
5	:	Very impressed with the sound quality and also like that they drown out any noise around me. Looking forward to using then while mowing this summer!The phone talk is an added bonus as well! One touch to answer any calls!What a convenient set up!
5	:	Very comfortable. Easy to store.  Works well.
5	:	Head phones are great. Easy to set up and use. Noise cancellation is fair to good.
2	:	Headphone sounded flat/thin in all cases. There was no depth/richness in the music.Returned

5	:	love them
5	:	Nice Headphones.
5	:	"Look great, sound great, really comfortable, and the price makes them that much better. If I had to be nitpicky, the charging cable is a little short, but that???s really the only thing I could find to criticize."
5	:	"Very lightweight, incredible sound. No complaints."
4	:	"Got these for my little guy (9 y/o) for Christmas.  They seem to work great so far and he loves them. However, the cord that came with them is already weak and doesn't work with one ear when using the cord.  Easy to be replaced, but not the best quality cord."
5	:	"I like the material, it keeps me at ease when I drop it on occasion. The sound quality is good; gets the job done. Battery lasts a day and a half for me, but I don't use it for longer than a couple hours at a time. Price is very reasonable."
5	:	Came as described
5	:	I was truly amazed superb audio and I received them on Saturday tried them for about an hour and didn't touch them until work Monday. I used them all day at work and they didn't die until halfway through Thursday!! I've recommended them to all my coworkers and friends!
5	:	love them

3	:	"only got a 3 because as soon as return window closed, they QUIT charging.  Anyone know what the warranty may be?  Thanks"

5	:	"very light, very comfortable, great sound"

5	:	Good sound good product

3	:	Material feels cheap. Wouldn't want to accidently drop them. Sound runs low but nice.

5	:	A good wireless headphone and cost effective too. Easy connection via bluetooth. I highly recommend this product.
4	:	Great sound quality for the price and very comfortable even with glasses! My only minor complaint is that the aux jack is on the left ear cup which is a little inconvenient for my setup. Luckily the cups seem to fit well even when I wear them backwards.

5	:	"It has good sound quality but then the sound from the right side of the headphone stop working after 4 months and to make it work I have to move the cable on the right side, not very durable.Edit= Got a new one, working good. Mpow customer service is great."
5	:	"These are exactly what I was looking for!  Sound is very good, and they are comfortable.  They pair easily and consistently with my device.  I would purchase these again."
4	:	I don't have much to say about these negatively except they could be louder and genuinely use some more bass. They're comfortable however and the adjustable slides could use some more hold as well. Great for the money though.
5	:	Great price and great quality. I should have bought them sooner.

4	:	"Great Sound, very LOUD output on max phone volume I am hearing impaired, so when i use it with my hearing air I get a slight frequency feed back when nothing is playing but other wise its def worth the buy."
5	:	"Material is comfortable but there is a faint Bluetooth buzz in the background, the battery life did last many hours though UPDATE: I received a replacement and the new headphones are perfect. 100% worth it."
5	:	Best set I have found. This is my second pair!
5	:	"Great quality, work perfectly... excellent price."

5	:	I bought these as a gift and they were well loved.  I plan on buying a pay for myself.

5	:	Nice headset
5	:	I bought these for my 9 year old. He loves them. Uses them all the time! They fit his head perfectly and the sound is phenomenal.
5	:	"I am extremely happy with these headphones. Once fully charged up they linked to my smartphone the first time. The sound is nicely balanced with a great sound. The buttons are on the right side of the earpiece and easy to use. So glad I went with Bluetooth, and they can also be used with included cord, as in airplane mode (Bluetooth off).  Highly recommended."
5	:	Very high quality material. Comfortable on the ear.
3	:	Sound quality is good. The battery life is amazing and they're comfortable.

5	:	My nephew loves them! They are perfect!
3	:	"These seemed to work fine and my 10-year-old thought they were great, but one of the ear cushions came off on a hot day.  It wasn't pulled - just loosened up and fell off when he picked up the headphones by the loop (whatever the part that goes over your head is called).  If you look through the reviews you'll see a few other complaints about this. I was able to get the pad back on but it's not easy and there is still no way it's going to not come off again.  It's just held in place by tension - a too-small strip of fabric is wrapped over a plastic part and is meant to hold the pad in place, but there is no adhesive or other parts that secure it there.  So unfortunately they're going back.UPDATE:  The vendor sent a replacement immediately at no charge. They appear to be the same model and probably will have the same problem, but I bumped these up one star for good customer service.  I give Patozon 5 stars for acting quickly to replace the first ones, but the headphones still have this potential problem that is hard to fix yourself.  As long as you are reasonably careful with them you should be fine, but if you look at the photos in the reviews you'll see a handful that show the problem I had with mine.  Other than this one issue, they seem to be great headphones for the money."

4	:	I have used for a couple of days now. Excellent sound quality so complaints yet.
1	:	Awful product. Ear piece came off after two uses. Would not go back on.
5	:	Great sound and easy to use.
3	:	"The sound is decent.  Has good bass,  without it being overbearing.Main gripe would be that I can hear everything around me very clearly.  Takes away from the immersion of audio dramas."
3	:	"The headphones work fine and all but in the first week of use trying it wired mode  it damaged, don't know why and no one seems to answer me, it only listens on the left side and I want to know how to fix it"
2	:	"Really disappointed by the quality for watching movies on my iPad. The sound is very 2 dimensional, with bright, chirpy dialog, but background sounds are so suppressed that it sounds like you are listening to one quiet thing with one loud thing laid over top of it. These had such high reviews, I really expected more. They do work slightly better for my Pzizz sleep app with my iPhone, but it still sounds --weird-- somehow.Something about it isn't a complete audio range. I'm not enough of an audiophile to accurately describe how it sounds as if there were a foreground and a background, but it's not a full-bodied, rounded-out sound. Ok. So the best way I can describe it, it's sort of like there's a top and a bottom but no middle to connect them. Like the top and the bottom are completely disconnected from each other, two tracks playing at the same time but not related.My only upside so far?? They fit adequately well and are very comfortable, and I have a wee tiny head, so I don't get to say that often!!I'm sure these will come in handy for some things, but I'll stick to my Marley earbuds for now."
4	:	"Fit nice, very soft ear pads. Easily connect and easy to use. Volume could be a little higher but other than that they work great."
5	:	"Very comfortable. Covers the entire ear. Sound quality is good. I use it mostly for flights and they work great. Great product for the price you pay. Although I wish it came w a hard cover case. Nonetheless, definitely recommend."
4	:	No problem pairing with my TV. Very good sound quality.
3	:	"Ehh, you get what you pay for. Sound quality is not that great either but what do you expect for the price."
5	:	I love them.
5	:	Super comfy and great sound! The quality of these headphones is very surprising for the price!
5	:	Great features. My grandson is going to help me use it well.
4	:	I really like these headphones. They are really comfortable and have great sound.  The control buttons are a little hard to use.
5	:	Loving how powerful the sound is. I wasn???t expecting such clear sound from this product but it delivered perfectly.
5	:	"Awesome! Exactly what I wanted. Fast shipping, great fit and awesome sound!"
4	:	Work very well.  Just wish they worked consistently with my XBOX controllers.  Sound was in and out.  Work great with my phone and computer.
5	:	"UPDATE:  Seller sent me a 2nd pair (no charge) as the sound quality was substandard on the first pair.This pair sounds great, kudos for the seller for quickly addressing the issue!"
5	:	"Comfortable, great sound.  Comparable to Beats, for a fraction of the price."

4	:	Excellent sound. Easy to setup.
5	:	Best headphones I Ever brought

5	:	We bought these for my son based on the number of positive reviews. They did not disappoint. He loves them and they look and function great. Nice quality and not the hundreds of dollars that you may spend for the popular brands.

5	:	Easy to use sounds great

4	:	"Comfortable, but cumbersome and not easy to figure out how to turn them off."
5	:	So far am very happy. The sound quality and battery life are great for the price. Hoping they have longevity. You have a customer that enjoys shairing their product endorsement with others.
5	:	Surprised at the quality of the sound at this price.
1	:	This mpow brand really sucks. The first time I bought it the power button broke and this one the ear pad came off.
1	:	Charge port broke already. Very poorly made.
5	:	It's been a lllooonnggg time and they are still going great. they passed my test but they shake a little when you hit that max bass on them
5	:	Been working great so far and has been everything I need it to be.I also like that it is not a noise-cancelling set...allows you to still be a part of the world around you when using. ;-)

5	:	The company replaced my headphones immediately and the new pair are working fantastically!
5	:	"Incredible! The headset is one of the most comfortable I've ever tried with great sound quality. And the price is amazing. Didn't have to be gauged paying for a similar headset for $300 more, great buy!!"
5	:	They work awesome. Long battery life fast charging. Comes with charging cord aux cord and bag to keep all together. Very happy with the way they work.
5	:	"Really good service. Great product, good quality and very cheap compared to other products in the market."
5	:	The ease of installing it with my Samsung tv. Comfortable wear.
2	:	"They worked great for a month, but then no longer turned on.  Sent back, will order something else."
5	:	"Great sound, easy to pair and really comfortable."
5	:	"Great product as advertise,  awesome battery time and comfortable"
4	:	"Headphones work great so far.  Battery life is great, still working on same charge over the last 3 days.  I use them 8 hrs a day.  The sound is rich enough for my needs at work.  The sound does seem to bleed outside of the headphones at modest volumes.  They do get LOUD.  Very comfortable to wear all day.  Bluetooth was easy to pair with iPhone 7 Plus, and work great.  Haven't tested out the distance.Microphone is HORRID.  Those that I speak with tell me that there is a loud, high pitched ""staticy"" noise that makes it difficult to hear me.All in all, I am satisfied with the purchase because I use microphone sparingly at work.  Do not recommend if you want to use them for frequent calls."
5	:	Great headphones! I am very happy with them!

5	:	durable and good sound quality. one charge lasts a long time.
5	:	The sound is out standing and the 20 hours battery life is great.
4	:	Good quality headphones with clear sound.  I really enjoy them
2	:	Average audio performance with plastic ear muffs that will make your ears sweat. To compound one ear piece fell off at third time of use so have returned . Buy nice or buy twice
5	:	"For the price, I was super happy with this purchase. The volume is great and the quality is sufficient."
5	:	"Comfortable, excellent sound quality and inexpensive.  A great value!"

4	:	The sound is good. Could be a little louder
5	:	Buen??simos..
3	:	Great headphones but they don't get loud enough. Great for my workout and not getting tangled up in a cord.
4	:	"just got these last night, they're comfortable, light, and they are really responsive.so, just kinda baseline what i expected from upgrading from wireless earbuds.though the earbuds i was using before worked well, they were more for during the day(school/public) and i always found it more of a hassle switching them from my phone to my laptop.and that's kinda the reason i decided to get these.I like these, and i recommend them, but i wouldn't use them in public over my earbuds."
4	:	Good
5	:	"Comfortable and easy to link. Voice prompt lets you when it's turned on, off, pairing, and connected."
4	:	Greatly reduces but doesn???t eliminate noise
4	:	"Noise reduction has a bit to be desired, but overall great headphones for the price. I would definitely buy them again."
4	:	I did not understand and was disappointed the dongle was not included so had to place a separate order. Now with the dongle the headphones are wonderful.
5	:	"I think this headset is excellent. It keeps a great charge on the wireless, which I use most often. The design is very good."
5	:	"Comfortable, love folding feature. Bass not bad, but could be a little deeper. Overall, great product  for a fraction of the cost!"
5	:	I loved everything about the headsets only needs a better way to control the volume
1	:	ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS!!! EXPOSED AND EXTREMELY FRAGILE WIRES ARE LOCATED AT THE BASE OF EARMUFFS. HEADPHONES BROKE WITHIN A FEW WEEKS USE!!!

1	:	the headphones are great however the microphone is not working it is showing connected by Bluetooth but does not pick up sounds

4	:	"decent pair, you can't beat the price!"
1	:	"It forces my mobile device (PUBG Mobile app) to use telephone audio rather than media audio, and the telephone audio is terrible. These headphones are unusable for this app. My device is an Android Galaxy Tab A. I have used many other headphones that had normal audio quality and were associated correctly with media and telephone. Returned.UPDATE: I give the company A+ for customer service. They automatically sent me replacement headphones at no charge, and they were very courteous. However, the problem still persists -- at least in the PUBG Mobile app. These headphones do not recognize media audio in this app on my device. Thanks for trying, but I still cannot use these."
2	:	I could not keep it over my ears for more than 10-15 minutes. It warms around the ears and becomes irritating while listening for longer than 10-15 minutes.

5	:	Liked it. Yet to see how long battery will hold over time.
5	:	"I agonized over this purchase for six months. I looked at reviews, I watched videos, I read tech specs, and did shot after shot of tequila crying into the night begging God to help me! Okay the first three are true. They arrived in one day in a really nice package. I have worn them on several bike rides and gym visits. I sweat like a whore in church and they stand up to the punishment. They have never fallen out. Even when I'm in full Rob Zombie metal thrash mode. I try to make them fall out and they will not.The app is nice and works perfectly. Also, I use Runkeeper and now I get heart rate data in that app. The sound is amazing just like all Bose products.I have Bose noise canceling headphones, a mini wireless speaker, and a Bose system in my car."
1	:	"For starters, I've always been a big fan of Bose products.  We have a 5.1 surround sound system in the house, I have noise cancelling headphones I use for travel, etc.I was given these as a Christmas gift in 2016.  The product worked flawlessly for about a year.  Evidently there is a 1-year warranty on the product, and of course just after Christmas 2017 the product started having issues.  It won't hold a charge, will shut down suddenly, etc.  For a Bose product, especially given the cost, I would expect much more."
5	:	"I have tried various inexpensive wireless earbuds / headphones over the last few years, and have never found a pair that beat out my good old-fashioned wired earbuds.  Well, I recently had the opportunity to try out both Bose and Jaybird wireless buds.  Both are similar in price, have gorgeous packaging, and have similar features.  Here are the results.SOUND- Bose: 10 of 10.  Absolutely astounding sound quality.  Simply the best I have ever heard at any price, wired or wireless, period.- Jaybird: 8 of 10.  Solid sounds, fine for podcasts or casual music listening.  Bass response is nowhere close to Bose, but with some equalizer settings on your device you can come closer.  Competitive with most other nice earbuds I have tried.FIT- Bose:  7 of 10.  Surprisingly good fit considering how HUGE the buds are.  Seriously, these things are big.  They apparently house the battery and electronics that power these (since they are wireless).  But for their size, they fit fine with the included inner-ear pieces (several sizes included).- Jaybird:  9 of 10.  Excellent fit.  Tiny compared to the Bose product.  These also include many options for earbud size and inner ear inserts that hold them in place, but they remain comfortable after several hours of constant use while running.FEATURES- Bose:  9 of 10.  These have the charging port directly in one of the earbuds, which works well.  You can download the Bose app, and amazingly you can even read your pulse from the buds!  This is a fun and useful feature for various types of training.- Jaybird:  7 of 10.  Has a separate little ""mini"" dock needed for charging.  You can download an app for the device to adjust the sound and perform a few other ""minor"" functions, but I wound up deleting the app and just connecting normally via Bluetooth.So do I have a favorite?  For daily exercise use I am gravitating to the Jaybird mostly because I prefer the fit and just do not care for the giant bud size on the Bose.  But for travelling or listening when I'm not active, the Bose wins out with superior sound.In summary, the Bose is a great product - recommended!"
1	:	"Bose passing off refurbished products as ""new"" on Amazon. I bought a pair of these a few months ago and decided to buy another pair for a family member as a gift because they seem to work well. I made sure to buy directly from Amazon and the product was listed as new. The box was sealed perfectly in plastic and looked brand new from the outside so it definitely was not amazon sending me a returned item. Upon opening and seeing the headphones I knew something was wrong because I had a pair already, they looked used and the battery was dead. All the accessories looked new but this was clearly a refurbished product. My fears were realized when I charged the headphones turned it on and it immediately started to try to pair to the previous owners devices. Every time it turned on it tried to connect to ""Lee"" and a ""Galaxy Note 2"". This product was clearly used and was a refurbished product and not a ""new"" item as described. I immediately returned the headphones to Amazon and will not be buying Bose products again."
4	:	"Still the best bluetooth in-ear headphones of early 2017 (8/10). Let me explain.Well, first, I cannot believe there are so many raving reviews claiming these headphones to be the ""best I have ever heard at any price, wired or wireless, period"". Um. Ignore Vine reviews. And then one-star reviews complaining about defective units -- well, every electronics is prone to defective units, and Bose has some of the best warranty policies, so please.So you're thinking about wireless in-ear headphones. As of 2017, your two best options are Bose Soundsport Wireless and Jaybird X3. Here's how they compare:SOUND (Bose: 8/10)-- Very good and fun sound. Warm and slightly bass-heavy, although the lowest bass rumbles as well as harsh trebles are cut off (like most bluetooth headphones). I wish mids had more clarity, but I'm nit-picking here. These aren't replacing my wired headphones, but if I'm traveling, I can definitely enjoy music with these.-- Jaybird X3 (7/10): These are slightly brighter-sounding headphones, with less bass impact but clearer mids and trebles. Still pretty good. These are closer to neutral, but high trebles are still rolled off. So it's up to personal preferences. I also think it depends on your ear fit, and if you can get a better seal than I did, then your experiences may vary (bass is the first thing to go with a poor seal).COMFORT (Bose: 10/10)-- I generally don't like to give perfect score to anything, but Bose really deserves a perfect ten here. This is the selling point of Bose. Despite the ugly bulky looks, the headphones are incredibly comfortable, and wires don't distract.-- Jaybird X3 (8/10): These have average comfort, like most other in-ear headphones. Wings help a bit. Wires are heavy and tug on the ear pieces when I move around a lot. Overall, significantly less comfortable than Bose.PRICE (Bose: $149)-- Bose is pricey. They're known to be pricey/over-priced, and discounts are hard to find.-- Jaybird X3 ($99). These are definitely a great deal, and you can often find cheaper deals.OTHERS-- Bose remote buttons feel weird to press. Buttons are big, not very clicky, and generally unpleasant to work with. Jaybirds feel better.-- Battery life is fairly advertised at 6 hours. I get around 7 hours. I wish it lasted longer. Jaybirds are advertised at 8 hours but I get around 7, same as Bose.-- Bose looks ugly, if you care about these things. Jaybirds look nicer. I personally don't care.-- Bose provides a more useful case. Jaybird case's opening is too small and frustrating to use on the daily basis.Overall, Bose Soundsport Wireless is extremely comfortable and sounds great. I wish the battery lasted longer, but I don't think any competition (as of 2017) provides a significantly better battery life, yet. Until then, Bose is still the bluetooth in-ear headphones to beat."
1	:	"First off, let me start by saying that I would love nothing more than to be able to give the Bose SoundSport headphones five stars. These are the most comfortable headphones I have even worn and the sound quality is excellent. The issue with these headphones is the build quality. I have used these headphones probably about 15 hours a week for the last 7 months and they are falling apart. For comparison, my wife has the Jaybird X3s and they feel like they could be run over and you wouldn't notice.The photos I've attached show a couple of the places where the headphones are falling apart. The outside of each ear piece is a rubber peice that attaches to a harder plastic peice that faces the ear. The rubber on both the right and left ear bud is detaching from the harder plactic peice. I feel like they could have made the whole ear bud out of the harder plactic and attached the two halves more securely. All prices of the X3s are nicely molded together and don't look like they will fall apart.Another thing that has come up is the rubber covering the control has separated from the body of the control. The buttons were always a little spongy, but now the volume down button is almost unusable with out moving the rubber cover into just the right alignment with both hands. The controls really should never been designed with a solid plastic body and a separate rubber cover. To compare to the X3s again, the controls on those headphones are a solid unit with individual buttons for volume up and down and play/pause.There are other little things as well such as the included clip breaking with a week and rubber pices that cover where the wire enters the earbuds coming lose and sliding down the wire.Given the durability issues with these headphones they cannot be recommended. I really hope Bose addresses these issues in the next version because these really are comfortable headphones with great sound, but until then I think I will continue to find myself stealing my wife's X3s as often as I can.Update: A little plastic piece broke off from the loose volume down button (see pic) and I now have no way to decrease the volume from the headphones without using my phone."
1	:	"THIS IS THE AMENDED REVIEWLess than a month after I began using the BOSE SoundSport Earbuds, the battery life has gone from 2 hours to no hours.  After having the headphones plugged into my computer overnight, when I pressed the power button, nothing happened.  The unit no longer holds a charge.  I guess I'll have to stick with wires when listening at the gym.And now the original review.I purchased these Bose SoundSports to replace a different brand of blu-tooth earbuds that quit working a week after I purchased them.  While the Bose headphones are a comfortable fit and do sound good while I am listening to either music or an audiobook when using the rowing machine or stationary bike at the gym, I am less impressed with the battery life.  I have never had more than about 2 hours of battery life since the purchase.  I won't go into the schematic of my workouts, but each last approximately an hour.  At the end of the 2nd workout, the headphones register that the battery is near depletion.  So much for the 6 hours of battery life Bose advertises.Get these if fit and sound quality rather than battery life are what you are looking for."
5	:	"This is my 2nd pair of these headphones - and they are my favorites. I also own an old pair of around-ear bose soundlinks, the soundsport free, and the apple airpods. All have their pros and cons, as I will explain below. The only experience I have with noise-cancellers is with the sony wh-1000xm2 that my wife got as a surprise gift (she loves them).These are my favorite headphones for running or working out, and also watching movies on an airplane. The sound and fit is nearly identical to the soundsport free. They sound like bose headphones - pretty good, you can probably get better sound but there will be compromises in other areas. The soundsport free's have a few strange compromises to eliminate the wire - phone calls only play through the right side, and they have trouble pairing to my laptop (a razer running windows 10)- they would only pair in headset mode and not music mode. I would blame razer or microsoft, but I've never had this problem with any other headphone. These Soundsport have no nonsense with oddities like that, and the reception is a bit better as the antenna is in the wire, not enough to make a difference in practice. But there is, of course, a wire. I consider this a good thing when I run (and I run almost every day) as I tuck it into my headband to keep them from moving. I also have a lot of hair so it can be hard to fit the free's back in on the fly, need to clear all the hair out of your ear first, same with any in-ear. You can also dangle one phone from the wire around your neck without worrying about it. The buttons are much easier to press. The only downside is, they charge using a micro-usb and not the usb-C that my laptop, phone, and nintendo switch use. In fairness, the frees, sony's, and bose's soundlinks use micro-usb, too, so you'll be stuck needing to worry about an extra charging cord no matter what.By comparison, I wanted to also mention how these compare to the airpods and free's. Both of those eliminate the wire, but with the addition of a charging case that has an extra battery. The apple case is quite discreet, whereas the bose free case is hilariously huge. If you keep your phone in an otterbox or it is a panasonic toughpad, you probably won't mind the bose case. It makes quite a bump in your jeans pocket. The airpods have some funky pairing mechanisms that make them difficult to use if you have other apple equipment - For work, my employer has given me an iphone 7 and an older macbook pro from 2015. Switching the airpods between these devices will occasionally require the device be signed out and back into icloud - which is a huge headache. After the 2nd time of hitting the massive icloud reset button in the sky, they have been relegated to phone use only with my xperia. This is where the airpods excel - phone calls play through both ears, you can use both, or either one, or even share one with a colleague for a conference call. The mike is great at noise cancelling, and I work in very noisy environments. Both pods have a mike and the work some voodoo when you wear both of them to cancel out almost all noise. They do a lot of really nice stuff.My personal phone is a sony xperia xz1, and the airpods pair to and work with the sony without any hiccup, never failing to pair. They also pair to my windows laptop fine, but will only connect to one device at a time (They forget the other device and must be re-paired, which is quite painless but still an annoyance compared to the Bose). They also sound really really bad, and don't have any controls other than a play/pause by either 'double flicking' either pod while it's in your ear, or removing one pod to pause. You can find better-sounding BT headphones than the airpods for under $20, and they will have much better controls, but they won't have apple branding. The airpods charging case requires an apple-specific lightning cable, but one comes in the box so it's not a huge deal.The soundsport free's, by contrast, feature the excellent sound quality of the soundsports, IMO they sound even better because they are newer. They are my favorite headphones for just listening to music around the house or taking a quick phone call. Unlike the airpods, they don't really work with just one. The right bud is the ""master"": it is used for phone calls (there is no mike in the left bud), it also has the +,...,- buttons on the top, which are slightly awkward because they are hard to press. The left bud does not play voice calls, it is used for music only. It also has the BT pairing button on it. You can almost get away with using only the right bud, so long as you don't want/need to switch devices. You can also use just the left bud, but the right bud needs to be kept within range (e.g., in a pocket) and also out of the charging case.However, the soundsport free's have one big advantage, or disadvantage depending on your use case, and there "
1	:	"Junk. The rubber seal keeps coming off the volume buttons. I have had to return these inferior headphones three times. The forth set has failed again and I will not bother getting a fifth set. These may be a Bose product, but they are junk. Spend you hard earned money on another brand."
3	:	"I bought these headphones almost a year ago - February of 2017.  I am about to return them for a replacement for the second time.  The quality and audio performance are top notch but the problem I have been having has to do with the volume controls.  The rubber around the volume controls pops out and there is no obvious way to ""pop"" it back in without potentially voiding your warranty.  I contacted Bose directly within six months of purchasing them for the first time this occurred.  Bose support is great and they set up a warranty replacement for me rather quickly and without a lot of trouble.  This morning, I noticed that my headphones are doing the same thing again.  I tried looking for some reviews that described this problem but haven't been able to find anything other than some ""sweat"" problem from 2016.I doubt my issue is related to sweat.  I do use my headset daily and it often just hangs around my neck.  I don't understand how this occurs but sweat is not the issue.If you're a power user and want trouble-free headphones, this may not be the unit for you.  Granted, Bose is going to provide you with great customer service but Bose is supposed to be a solid name in audio technology.  Their audio quality is definitely high-bar.  But this issue is annoying and should be investigated and corrected."
1	:	"The headphones fit well into my ear and stay in through hard running, but since I first received them, and over the entire 6 months of use, they have been really hard to charge. I use the included charger, and about 4 days out of 7, the battery dies within 10-30 minutes of my turning them on, even when I've charged overnight. I'm not sure if I got a lemon or not, but I am going to try to return these. The longest charge I've ever gotten is about 60 minutes. I would not recommend these."
5	:	"LOVE THESE!  Let me count the ways:  I went on CNET.com to find the BEST headphones (after being disappointed with a crappy pair that I bought here trying to save $).  These SOUND AMAZING.  And they FIT in my ears a completely new way:  they sit in my ear, snugly, without feeling like my finger is stuck deep in my ear (if that makes sense).  But I can still have a conversation at the gym; ideal.  I LOVE them being cordless -- omg, to be on a spin bike and not worried about the distance from my phone, lol.  And...  HEART-RATE MONITOR -- I thought that would be a tedious set-up and I would never use it?  Wrong -- I'm pedaling along looking at my heart-rate go up and down in real time!  And get this: even the little pouch it comes with is perfect: it's flexible so you can jam the headphones back in, and even has a carabeaner to attach it to my backpack! IF YOU""VE READ THIS FAR, you're a weirdo like me, who actually reads a lot of reviews before choosing.  BUT THESE NOW!  :)"
1	:	"After 9 months of frustrating use, finally died over this past weekend. Every couple weeks it would start buzzing and only stop when plugging into charger to reset it. On/off button had become harder to push because the rubber cover seems to have shifted to the side and I can't put it back in place. Now doesn't work at all because for some reason is not recognized by my multiple devices (so its the headphones, not my device). For $200 I expect them to work longer than 9 months. Other less important issues: they talk too much! when turning on to pick up a call, it says several words which means you can't hear the other person, rubber cover on the volume switch popped off and can't fix, pulse isn't taken unless the app is open and active which means no analytics/graphs - you have to be looking at the app to get info - no ability to set a target HB range while exercising.  DO NOT BUY THESE - ZERO STARS."
2	:	"*****BACK WITH AN UPDATE*****So I contacted BOSE and they replaced mywirless soundsport citron with a brand new set. BOSE customer service emailed me a UPS shipping label that I had to print and take to the closest UPS store front where the shipping package was provided. It was shipped and in less than 2 weeks a brand new unit arrived at my home - Thats Right Brand New. In addition, BOSE restarted the warranty for the new set I recieved - So if these malfunction they are covered - NOT from the purchase time of the original - but from the replacement time of the new set. BOSE - GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE IN SUPPORTING YOUR PRODUCT.Today i am enjoying that great quality again thanks to the BOSE customer service commitment.6 months into using my BOSE citron soundsport wireless headphones I have to report some things. SOUND - amazing (its BOSE), BATTERY - when I charge to 100% the charge has lasted and currently still lasts as advertised, FUNCTION - WIRELESS CONNECTION AND FUNCTION -SO FAR SO GOOD, VERY COMFORTABLE (again its BOSE), CONSTRUCTION - VERY POOR NOT BOSE QUALITY - VERY DISAPPOINTED. eventually the internal components will be exposed and consequently deteriorate way before they should during normal use due to poorly designed construction. See Pics."
1	:	"I am a Bose fan! However, the last 2 Bose headsets Ive had were awful. Apparently Bose won't let their headphones get loud. The clarity was well but volume was lacking. The headphones stay in your ear so A+ on that whoever said they fallout alot, I would have to question them. The reason for a 1 star is due to volume and most importantly the spottiness of this device. It was spotty at times when listening to music and this headset was notorious for the bluetooth to shut off. I would be talking to people and all of a sudden the bluetooth would be off. This happened daily! I gave it several chances but it kept doing it. Very awful product Bose!"
4	:	"I bought these 10 months ago, and unfortunately the power button broke after near daily use for that time. I contacted Bose support and within 10 minutes they were able to set up a replacement, including them paying for the return shipping on my broken headset. I was mildly apprehensive about calling them because I have heard mixed reviews from others, but my experience couldn't be better. Now about the headset itself:Comfort - this is the best feature of these. Bose in ear headphones are the most comfortable for me to wear, so when they made a wireless one I knew I had to try it. They are about 90% as comfortable as their wired model, because the flanges are a bit bigger to keep them from falling out of your ears, but I am 100% satisfied. If you like Bose in ears then these will work for you.Battery life - perfectly reasonable. It is not all day performance, but easily 5+ hours on a single charge, and they recharge quickly in-between uses. While I hope in a few years they make them with 10+ hour life, with today's technology these are great, and perfectly adequate for normal useFit - I use these for exercise as well, and this is where they shine. I have zero issues with them coming out of my ears, and no risk of hitting a cord going down to my phone that happens too often with wired headphonesSound Quality - My over ear bose headphones and bose speakers both sound better than this, but they have the space to have a driver over 10x as large. For such a small driver I am incredibly satisfied with the sound quality, and greatly prefer them to any more basic headphones I've usedConnection - good but not perfect. They can remember at least 4 devices, be connected to up to 2 at a time, and play audio from only 1 at a time. This seems a reasonable compromise, but I will note that about every 2-3 months they seem to forget all their connections and you have to tell all your devices to forget the headphones, then repair each of them. A bit of a hassle, but not the end of the worldOverall: I am perfectly satisfied with the product. I was a bit disappointment they broke in under a year, but they give me a whole new year with my replacement set so they certainly stand behind their product and I am content. They sound great, work well, and I would buy them again."
3	:	"Now that I have had these headphones for a few months I can tell you that although they sound great, they have two major flaws and are definitively not worth $150.First the bad. Number one is the battery life, they advertise it as lasting six hours on one charge, I'm lucky if I get three on mine, I'm not lying when I tell you this. Number two, is total volume output, they are not very loud at all. If I'm running on a treadmill and can still hear noise around me and find myself craving more volume, then it's not me, it's the product. I don't even think I listen to music that loud. I mostly listen to Jazz, Latin, and Flamenco music, no volume greedy Rock or Hip Hop, etc. The earpieces are bulky and a little heavy, they hurt after about one and a half hour.Now the good, sound definition is great and the bass response and clarity is the best I've ever heard on headphones this size."
5	:	"I finally found a wireless option to use with (not entirely replace) my wired Bose SoundSport earbuds.  I first tried the Jaybird X3s but had to send them back because they kept falling out of my ears.  Even the Comply ear tips kept coming out, and when they were in, I didn't like the earplug-like removal from outside sounds.  I was hesitant to switch over to wireless because of battery life issues, but the Boses have proven to last plenty long on one charge so far, and the wireless convenience is well worth having to charge them every once in a while.  I read countless reviews on the Jaybird X3s and these Bose SoundSports (and have tried both) and, at least for me, Bose win easily.  Well worth the additional $40."
1	:	In the past year I have ordered this product three times. Twice for myself and once for my significant other. The first time I ordered a pair they were amazing. Sound quality was on par with all other Bose products. They lasted for quite a while until a freak gym accident crushed them. At this point I ordered two more pairs of these. The first pair worked for a grand total of two weeks before a cracking noise appeared in the left earbud. The second pair did not work out of the box. The battery would not even charge. So all in all as long as you get a good pair of those headphones they are amazing but be warned they do send out several defective products as well as I have had several friends complain of similar issues. Very disappointing to see this from a company I have regarded as the best for so long.Update: I have now had a new paid for about 35 days and they are no longer keeping a charge. I will no longer be buying these.
1	:	"Bought these about less than a year ago. Sound quality unsurprisingly is great, however I think Bose failed when attempting to make a ""water resistant/sweat proof"" product. All the rubbery pieces are stretching out and coming apart. Volume buttons went first, then the rubber black casing sound the earpieces. The rubber plug for the charging port has also swollen to the point it will not stay in the port. One of the Bose badges on the earpiece has fallen off as well. Looking at the photos it may seem that they have been abused or not taken care of, I assure you that is not the case. I do use them a lot but not in extremely active situations or in the elements. I use them indoors and during work for maybe 2-3 hrs a day.  I will continue use these as long as they keep working (haven't had a single technical issue) but I will definitely not replace them for another pair."
3	:	"This review will get a little detailed and the main goal is to compare the Bose SoundSport with the??LG Electronics Tone Pro HBS-750 Bluetooth Wireless Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black, which I have been using for almost five years now.  The short version of the review: The Bose has much better sound quality but in most other regards, the LG HBS models are functionally superior.  Here is some detail:1) Basis of the review: five years of using the LG units across the line of their models HBS-700W, 730, 750, 760, and 900.  The Bose I have had for only 3 months, so too soon to make any longevity claims; only almost daily use of both units for the past three months. My application is 3-6 hours per day, split between listening to audio books, podcasts, and other voice media (70%) and with perhaps 30% to music.  I use both for phone calls and to participate in VOI meetings, perhaps 5% of my usage per day.  A typical example was today when I listened to my book as I worked around the house and garden and now am enjoying some music while I work on the computer.  As background, I have owned all three generations of Bose Quiet Comfort over-the-ear headphones and would not get on a plane without my current QuietComfort 35 wireless.  I was a sound engineer in an earlier life and own several other headphones, including studio-quality AKG K 240.  I have also tried a long series of portable wireless headphones and would not consider anything except the LG and the SoundSport.2) Comfort: this one is subjective so I will dispense with it quickly.  I find that over time, the LG BS-750 are more comfortable.  And by time, I mean hours of continuous wearing.  I put headphones on shortly after I get up and often wear them through my commute, for calls and music while at my desk, for the commute home, and around the house at night.  The comfort difference is not huge and is, of course, too subjective to be important; neither is uncomfortable.3) Sound quality: also an easy one to settle.  Despite efforts from LG, their headphones are not even close to the Bose in terms of quality of listening to music.  The voice listening is also better with Bose, but the difference is minimal or at least not significant for that purpose.  Both seem to generate about the same sound levels.4) Bluetooth reception and performance.  No significant difference here that I could detect.  I did not carry out extensive technical comparisons and focus here on real world and subjective comparisons.5) Ease of use and wearability.  This is where things start to get different and defining.  The LG have a neck collar that contains the electronics and light earbuds connected with very slim wires and the result is a comfortable and stable experience.  I can wear them without adjustment for hours, even with only a single earbud in place, a convenient way to track my phone while still having a conversation with someone.  None of this works well with the Bose.  The wire that connects the earbuds slides around with my own activity and I regular have to realign it so that it does not tug on one or the other ear.  In a feeble attempt to compensate, Bose provides a small clip that I could never get to work; it also required that I actively unclip before taking the headphones (or my shirt) off.  The one-ear mode that is so easy with the LG is almost impossible for more than a few minutes with the Bose.  As soon as I move around even my desk, the implanted earbud starts tugging from my ear.  Another important feature is how comfortable the headphones are to wear when not in use and here, again, the LG is superior.  The earbuds snap into the collar unit via magnets (or some models retract) so that the whole package hangs around the neck unnoticed.  The Bose, by contrast, dangle in the way, slide around, and as often as not, end up falling off (or are annoying enough that I remove them and leave them lying around somewhere).  A simple solution would be for the earbuds to connect to each other but only other brands have thought of this, not Bose.6) Wind noise.  One of the features I see in reviews is the utility of the Bose for runners and cyclists, with the touted benefit that a lack of noise cancellation allows one to wear the SoundSport and still be aware of acoustic activity in the vicinity.  While the comparison may be apt for a noise canceling headphone, the LG achieve this goal in a much better manner; they block less ambient sound and allow the single-ear mode so important when cycling in traffic.  Much more important, the wind noise that the Bose SoundSport generate when cycling makes them almost useless, even at modest speeds (e.g., 20 km/h).  I found the background wind noise completely overwhelmed the text of my book to the point I could not follow it.  The LG actually reduce wind noise and only at 50 km/h+ do I need to turn them off because I cannot hear w"
5	:	"I go to the gym a lot and have been looking for a great sounding pair of wireless in ear headphones. I have tried several, from the original beats to the powerbeats and most recently the beats x. These blow them all away......big time. They fit in my ear very well (with the medium ear tips that come on the headphones) and had a small and a large size as well. From the moment you power them on they are (in my opinion) much better than beats. When turned on they tell you what device they are connected to and how much battery is left. Another great feature is the call feature. When you receive a call it tells you who is calling (if you have them as a contact) this way you don't have to take your phone out of your pocket to check who is calling before answering. The call quality was amazing, way better than on my beats.Now, the sound quality, in my opinion is MUCH better...MUCH MUCH better, than the beats x. Deep bass, clear voice. and they are very comfortable as well for the duration of my home long workout.For battery life, I have only used them once so far, but at the start of my workout they were 70%, and at the end (a little over 1 hour) they were at 60%. I listened to spotify the whole time and made one roughly 10 minute phone call, only losing 10% battery life.For anyone shopping around, or debating on whether to purchase these headphones versus the beats in ear headphones, take it from someone who has tried them.......buy these BOSE soudnsport, you won't be disappointed"
5	:	"I wanted to wait on reviewing these until I had a significant amount of use, as I've had other headsets in the past which either didn't hold up physically, or had rapidly diminishing battery performance. I'm pleased to report that the SoundSport headphones are still going strong, after months of near-daily use. I've worn them in a variety of activities, including running, biking, and just taking long walks, and the headphones never dislodged from my ears. Battery life is good - I've averaged 6+ hours of listening to music on a full charge. I've never had a phone call last more than 2 hours, but I would expect similar performance. Although the fit felt a little odd initially (they are larger than most earbud-style models I've worn), after a few sessions I became completely comfortable with them. The rocker control under the right earbud is a bit tricky, as you can't see it when you're wearing them and the contours of the buttons are not so distinctive that you can tell by touch alone if you're on the right button. Sound quality is excellent! Low range comes through with good depth and little distortion, even at high volumes. Voice performance is also great, and other callers are able to hear your voice clearly. One issue is that the microphone can be overwhelmed by wind when outdoors...but that's been my experience with every phone headset (wired & wireless), so I wouldn't consider it a knock on these. Charging is fast and easy with the mini-USB connector, and pairing to the phone (Android in my case) is simple - and the Bluetooth range before connection is lost is surprisingly good. Although these are more expensive than most other models I looked at, I'm confident the extra money was worth it. I definitely prefer them to the Plantronics BackBeat, which are similar in style & size.Pros- Great sound!- Solid battery life- Well-constructed & durable- Remains in-place, even during intense exerciseCons- Larger earbud size than most models- Some initial ""awkwardness"" in feel- Rocker control could use more distinctive button textures"
5	:	"I come from an era where earbuds were supposed to be annoying. If you didn't feel them plugging your ear, they needed to be shoved in so they were that much more uncomfortable. That's why I thought these Bose SoundSports didn't fit me! Sure, I heard my podcasts better than ever (as well as any noises that walkers of dogs in the early morning should be aware of), but I kept trying to push them into my ear. Why? Because they were too  comfortable!When I finally figured out they they weren't going to fall out, I realized they were SUPPOSED to be comfortable and began to enjoy these little beauties. And enjoy them I do!I often forget that I have earbuds in my ears, which makes me wonder where the voices are coming from! No, really, these earbuds are light, comfortable, and completely secure as they rest in your ear. (Please note that I am almost 60 years old and do not engage in anything more strenuous than walking uphill at a brisk clip. I cannot attest to their stick-in-your-ear-persistence if your thing is doing backflips on a trampoline. Just saying...).As for sound quality, features, and the like, again, I'm from the era of transistor radios and VHS tapes. All I can say is that the sound is great and even I figured out how to use them with no help from anyone (including Google). Bose has, once again, lived up to it's well-deserved reputation."
5	:	"Very, very good headphones.  I had purchased (and then returned) multiple sets of headphones in the last several months.  I kept these.  I am very picky with audio.  I'm not saying I know what I'm talking about, from a technical point of view.  I'm saying that I refuse to use headphones that don't make my music sound good.  These headphones make my music sound great.  The bass is sufficiently, but not overly, bassy.  They're very clear.Oh, and they work as a phenomenal headset for phone calls.  I have a Pixel XL and folks seem to prefer to hear me talk on these Bose headphones than to hear me right on the Pixel XL built-in mic (even when not in speakerphone mode).  You can't hear yourself quite so clearly (because these earbuds plug your ears and your speaking doesn't necessarily get funneled back into your ears over the phone), so you might need to work to get used to using them as a phone headset for phone conversations.  Once you do, though, you will love it.I don't love the tap=pause, 2x tap=advance, 3x tap=reverse button.  I would have preferred them be on three separate buttons instead.  But I'll get over that.  I don't think joining those three features into a single button saved them enough space/parts for it to be worth it, especially when a double-tap sometimes gets misunderstood as a single-tap.  And vice versa.  It's pretty annoying for the music to pause instead of advance to the next track.  Or, worse, the opposite."
4	:	"Bought this product based on good reviews online and they sure are right. It has balanced sound from low to high frequencies, with an emphasis on the bass, but it's tight and not too boomy. Overall sound is very well engineered by Bose. I did think the highs could be a bit harsh or piercing at high volume though. When it comes to sound stage, it is not that great. But that's common with earbuds. Overall for the $99 price I paid, considering this is Bluetooth technology, the sound is not bad at all. I don't know how Bose does it without utilizing the AptX/HD codec.I like it that the earpieces don't need to be inserted completely into the ear canal to achieve a tight seal to have good bass response. This makes it more comfortable to wear compared to other in-ear headphones. The earpieces stay very secure and feels comfortable. Kudos to the engineers! The earpieces protrude a lot but I guess that's needed to house the drivers. Personally I prefer a cable between the two earpieces so that they are less likely to be lost.Can't quite comment on the batter life yet. I ordered it yesterday morning and received it around 8 pm, and charged it for about 30 minutes while the battery indicator is still flashing yellow, then I hooked it up with my LG G6, and the Bose Connect app says the battery level is 100%. After that I have been listening to music for maybe about 2-3 hours, and the app reported the battery level to be 80%. The rated battery life is around 6 hours, and likely everyone else, I do wish it could be longer, like maybe 12 hours. But these days, we are all used to charging devices daily. If only these earphones can be charged wirelessly like the Apple charging pad.Manufacturers are ditching the 3.5 mm audio jack on mobile devices these days, and I am glad that wireless technologies are finally catching up on sound quality that makes this move more acceptable and also more importantly affordable by consumers. This set of headphones are overall a great product and will be my daily headphones from now on. Time to get rid some of my other wired headphones and move on I guess."
2	:	"I enjoyed using my Bose headphones. They were comfortable in my ears and the sound quality was great. However, I am now looking for another pair of headphones after using the Bose headphones for only 14 months. The issue began with the rubber casing around the ear piece starting to warp. Because of this, the power button under the rubber casing fell out, making it difficult to turn the device on and off. Another issue that i've had, although more cosmetic, is that the logos on both earpieces have fallen out. This is also a result of the warping rubber. I recommend reading other reviews from people that have had the product for over a year to get a true sense of the longevity of this product. Its unfortunate because one of the reasons that I was willing to spend a little more for the headphones was because I thought I was getting quality that would last and pay for itself over time. Guess not..."
5	:	"Pairing:Pairing was great. I used them with an Android Pixel XL and no problem.  Plus you can also use NFC to pair them which is a great plus.This said, I downloaded the app and it was useless as I could not initially pair my headphones to it ??? it kept telling me to put them in pairing mode, which I would, but it still would not pair.  I use these w/o the mobile app.Sound:Sound was EASILY the best of the bunch ??? I tried 5 headsets (see other reviews).  The bass is deep. Maybe this is possible because they are so huge in your ear!Fit:Fit excellent once on the ear ??? also the best of all I tried.  Super fast and easy to put in and out and I love the clip on the back to ensure you don???t loose them.  I lost my last set (Epic 2s) because although they were wrapped over my neck, I forgot about them and they fell off.  Use the clip!These are HUGE buds though.  Silly Huge.  But the trade off is the great sound i guess.Call Quality:I know its not their primary function but call quality (on receiver end) was terrible.  It seems there is no mic function at all I have to hold the phone up to my face, which defeats the purpose of hands free.Overall, of all the sets I tried, these were the ones I picked.  As a bonus I got a cyber Monday deal and got them for $99!My only complaint (other than call quality) is I wish they were slightly smaller, and the battery lasted longer.  It seems to drain much faster than all the others I tried.I have also tried Apple Airpods, Bose Soundsport, Epic 2 BT, and the LG HBS730, and Jaba Elite.  See other reviews, but the bose were my final choice with the Epic a close second."
2	:	"I am writing this review approximately a year after I bought the headphones.  I used them daily ...mostly at the gym but also when cycling and on runs.  Initially there was some growing pains, especially with running and the headphones popping out but the different size buds do make a difference in terms of snug fit.The reason I'm giving them such a low review is that they're just not durable.  When you pay over $100 for headphones, you expect them to last a year or so.  Even 6-7 months into it, when going for bike rides I noticed that sound would drop out here and there if I held my neck in a certain way.  But after 11 or so months they have just fallen apart.  The covering of the bluetooth/on button has slipped off entirely and now the the bluetooth button is exposed, they don't work at all.I've not abused the headphones in any way and by and large they are well taken care of.  But even with hard, regular use, I would expect the quality to be much better in terms of build, especially from an 'elite' and certainly pricey, headphone manufacturer like Bose.  I've switched to the Jabra Elite 65t, as I don't want to purchase bose sport headphones anymore (I still love my QC35's) and so far so good, but the jury will be out til I see how well they hold up over the next year."
5	:	"I have been using these headphones every day for almost 5 months now and they work just as well as the day I received them. Making the switch to the iPhone 7, I didn't want to have to carry around the lightning to 3.5mm headphone dongle everywhere if I lost the Apple lightning headphones so I decided to make the jump and purchase some wireless headphones. I never liked the idea of the fully wireless ones (i.e. those that look like Bluetooth earpieces) so these were perfect for me.I work a desk job that allows me to listen to music while I work so these are in my ears all day every day. They are very comfortable; I've used some headphones that have irritated my ears after a few hours but I'll wear these at work and again when I'm working out. They stay in place even while running - I think is thanks to the design of the ear pieces. While at work I'll use one side at a time and leave the other side draped over my shoulder. There are no issues with this as long as you use the provided clip that connect directly to cord. I recently broke this clip due to my own clumsiness and every once in awhile I need to adjust how it is draped so that it does not pull too tightly but it isn't anything that isn't manageable.Battery life is exactly what I would expect for Bluetooth headphones. I get approximately 3-5 days use between charges. That is with me using these headphones for about 9 hours every day. I did not purchase the pair with the charging case so these charge via USB. I'll plug them in when I get down to about 30% battery life (which the headphones conveniently tell you in-ear when you turn them on) and I'll have a full charge in about an hour or so. They also come with a small case that is perfect to throw in your bag when you're on the go.The microphone/volume adjust also works very well. I use the microphone daily for phone calls and the person on the other end never has any complaints about the sound. I was told that the sound is clear and it amplifies so that you can be heard.I definitely recommend these headphone for anyone that doesn't want to be tethered to their device! The sound is excellent and they are very comfortable.Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones, Aqua"
2	:	"I am a very loyal Bose buyer. I've found that their quality is always really great, and their customer service is always helpful in trying to make things right. But the battery life on these headphones is so bad. I don't know that I can listen to them on the way to work, turn them off, and have enough battery to make it home at the end of the day. Even after leaving it at a full charge over night, when I remove them from the charger, it says I have a charge of 90%. I just removed them from the charger after 7-10 hours. Another really annoying feature is when you are listening to anything, the automatic voice will chime in to let you know you've connected to another device -- or has disconnected. It's just a bumbling interface with very poor battery life. I should have just gotten the AirPods."
1	:	"Needless to say the sound is just perfect. this is my 4th pair of earbuds from BOSE. I purchased this item on March 24, 2017, 40 days ago, and the earpiece started to fell apart. I am treating the headphone like a jewel (because BOSE craft jewels), I am not taking it to any gym or outdoors, just in my office or inside my home. I am kind of worry now with this purchase and I don't know how to get this resolved.UPDATE AUGUST 24, 2017Exactly 5 months later, happened what I supposed it will happen... No longer working!!! My humble by ACCURATE recommendation is ""AVOID THIS PRODUCT"" way too expensive to last 5 months only, at this point is my worst BOSE ever, you can consider this purchase as a scam. Very disappointed"
3	:	"I really like the sound of my Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones.  For a ""sport"" headphone though, the physical quality of the product is cheap.  I've had these for 5 months and the rubber around the product, where the on/off button and charging ports are, is coming apart.  For a product from BOSE who prides itself on great, quality and expensive products, this is disappointing.  That being said, the replacement procedure is painless - even if I have to return at my own expense.As compared to Bowers and Wilkins wired headphones, the sound quality is right up there with B&W.  I have absolutely no complaints on how they sound.  The APP for these is also sub-par, doesn't really enhance the headphones in any way.  I really love these for what they're intended for and am hopeful that with a replacement, I may not have the same physical appearance issues that really make this product look cheaply made.**edited 11/27/2017 - Customer service quality is great, no questions asked my earphones were exchanged and what I thought would be at my own expense for the return turned out to be postage paid by BOSE, the sent me a return label later, I just hadn't seen it in my e-mail when this review was written."
5	:	"These replaced my wired Bose in-ear buds. I've been a Bose fan for many years and own over the ear QC2's, MIE2's, a sound bar and other Bose devices that I enjoy.  I like the sound of the wired MIE2 but I wanted to cut the cord for more freedom while wearing my ear buds. These do exactly what I had hoped. The ""stay hear+"" tips are a definite improvement over the older version. I insert them into my ear and twist the bud gently rearward to provide a solid hold. These buds are NOT noise cancelling but the design of the tips keeps out quite a bit more noise than the older design.  Pairing to my MacBook, iPad, iPhone and smart tv was simple.  The best part is the sound.  Both voice and music are pleasantly balanced across the frequency range. I had a cheap pair of wireless I bought last year (<$30) and the sound on those is like listening through a tin can. I did like the freedom of wireless though.  What a difference the SoundSports are. Many have noted the size of the bud being large. It is a bit big but that really doesn't detract from the design or comfort.  My only concern would be the interference you might get trying to wear them inside a bike or cycle helmet. Haven't tried that yet. The on/off and pairing control mounted on the right bud is easy to find but maybe a bit ""mushy"" to the touch. The inline control for volume and phone response is easily accessible and intuitive but also a bit soft. Not a serious issue by any means but be aware. The alligator clip to secure the headphones to your shirt is an improvement over the old style but still can pull off the cord fairly easily. Despite these few minor flaws I give these Bose SoundSport headphones a full five star rating. You won't be disappointed."
3	:	"My son purchased these headphones to use with his Apple Watch at the gym, and he said, it pains him, but he cannot recommend them.  He now owns several Bose headphones that he's purchased over the years (over the ear noise cancelling; in-ear noise cancelling, over the ear bluetooth, and in-ear bluetooth sport headphones), so he finds Bose high quality. This is the first pair of headphones that has frustrated him.It may be because of possible electrical interference from cardio equipment, but these Bose SoundSport Pulse Wireless Headphones do not maintain connection with his Apple Watch (and when connected to his iPhone, using Polar's app, the heart rate will read ridiculous inaccurate numbers).  And, when these headphones are connected properly, they are finicky, the left ear bud's contact disconnecting and reconnecting without being touched.Ultimately, if you are interested in wireless bluetooth headphones, go with the Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones, that don't have the heart rate monitor.  They work great -- and are less expensive."
2	:	"Bottom line, they sound good, for the price.  Caveat:  When they work.Mine worked flawless, for about 6 weeks.  I used them to train (running) 3-5 times a week, in 45-80 minutes at a time.  Used them at the gym for 30-60 minutes at a time.  No issues, at all.  Great battery life, decent seal, good enough audio quality.Then, I ran my first half marathon (first organized race).  Around mile 10, they lost sync, and would not reconnect.  I didn't think much of it, but I was frustrated, as now I couldn't get my pace/time updates, and I wasn't in position, nor did I want to hold my phone in my hand.  I spent the money on these for several reasons.  Tempo playlist, updates from the Runkeeper app, reliability.Now, they will randomly power on and off without prompt.  I must charge them overnight, take them straight to the gym, as they power on and off the whole way, then re-pair them with my phone when I get there.  Once paired, they seem reliable.  Still, they power on and off, without prompt.  Update firmware?  Can't.  The unit won't stay powered on long enough to complete it.  Sometimes it makes it 60%.  Sometimes its 90%.  Never completes.So tell me, would you spend $150, get 6 weeks of flawless function, fail when you needed it, and be glitch since, and have a decent taste in your mouth?  I don't.Audio quality?  Decent...  This isn't entirely due to the drivers, but more so to the seal.  I use Westone triple and quad drivers for monitoring on stage, and casual listening, when being wired is feasible.  I'm not expecting these to sound amazing, and unfortunately, I think the drivers actually sound great.  The issue is the seal, or lack thereof.  The three size options they have, don't quite fit my ear canal, but they are proprietary, so it is what it is.  If they could utilize the Comply Foam tips used for most in-ear monitoring systems, these things could have GREAT potential in audio quality.  Want tight, clear bass?  The seal is what makes that happen.All in all, I'm rather disappointed, and its frustrating.  We'll see if I can manage a replacement pair, or if I'm stuck with these, and the frustration of it all, because I truly wanted to love them.  I've been through several low-end BT earbuds, and these are definitely the best.  May resort to apple airpods, if this situation goes unresolved."
1	:	"Total garbage. Started falling apart after 6 months and then the battery life went. I called customer service as they were still under warranty and while the agent was able to help me with a replacement he was extremely unprofessional and inappropriate with me on the call (asked questions about my age, made strange sexual jokes). I contacted Bose about the agents behavior and they claimed they are looking into it but havent had an update from them. Total waste of time and money. Will never buy these again and I am not impressed with Bose as a company at this point."
2	:	"Sound: 5Design/Use: 2Battery: 1I have the wired sound sport model but upgraded because my new iPhone doesn???t accept the audio plug without an adapter.Sound:As I would expect from Bose, the sound is full and fantastic!Use:It feels bulky in the ears, much heavier than the wired version, and easily falls out unless wedged in well. I wear the buds around my neck so it has support (and so it won???t fall to the ground if it falls out of my ears) but it often gets caught, pulls, then falls out of the ears???especially with only one in the ear.The earbuds also have a general Bluetooth issue, where it doesn???t always ring in the ear with an incoming call and often requires me to click my iPhone audio button and select ???Bose soundsport??? when accepting calls. I don???t know whether this issue stems from poor Bluetooth protocol implementation by Bose or by Apple, but it defeats the purpose of ???hands free.???Battery:A couple months in and the battery dies after three to four hours, which, in my opinion, isn???t heavy use . This disappoints me the most out of its issues."
3	:	"After a lengthy review of multiple different Bluetooth model earbuds, to include, but not limited to: Apple Airpods, Jabra, and several others, I chose these Bose Soundsports due to their praise received for sound quality and great price during Black Friday. As a very avid strength training individual, I used these approximately 5-6 times while at the gym and running. I found myself constantly trying to turn these up, but they were up to their max. Bluetooth sync was easy, but also found myself constantly pushing them into my ears to block noise and due to their bulky design they wanted to slowly ease their way out of my ear while moving around. They felt comfortable and I liked the wired vs. truly wireless model for the use of the volume up and down toggle on the neck cable. After trying extremely hard to love these because I did not want to buy into more of Apple's monopoly of products, I eventually returned these to Amazon after a couple days of use and purchased Airpods instead, which I have come to like after still having to purchase additional silicone ear wraps to stay in my ears while being active. Hope this helps someone else."
1	:	"Purchased these less than a year ago when they were on sale for $99 instead of a $149. I love Bose products and have always been very pleased with them. Except today the rubber that encases the buttons started coming off as my picture shows. This obviously isn???t good as now dust and dirt will start to get inside and eventually cause them not to work. I attempted to get an exchange done through amazon (yes I know it???s been about 10 months since my purchase) BUT I wasn???t asking for a refund I was asking for an exchange and figured a trillion dollar company could work with their customers, especially one who spends thousands of dollars a year with them, well I thought wrong. The first customer service representative gave me hope saying to send them pictures and that they would escalate the issue and provided me a phone number to call. That number of course was an invalid phone number. So I contacted them again and the new representative said there was nothing they could do. At that point I asked to speak with a manager and got the run around again saying there was nothing they could do. They attempted to still try and provide me with the same number the first representative did which is an invalid phone number. I told them that multiple times yet they still tried to provide me a bogus number and said sorry there???s nothing they can do. I???m hoping the manufacturer will see this review and contact me but honestly not getting my hopes up"
2	:	"The sole reason for buying these was to have a nice set of wireless earbuds to use in the gym. For the first six months they worked great, then one day out of the blue they became extremely inter mitten with the bluetooth connection. At first I though it was caused by interference on the crowded flight back from Spain I was on when it began, but the problem persisted. I read some forums online and I am certainly not the only one with this issue. After doing a firmware update and software updates on the iPhone, nothing improved.It is now clear to me that the bluetooth receiver is in the right earbud, I know this because the headphones ONLY work when HOLDING THE PHONE NEXT TO MY RIGHT EAR. If the device streaming music is not in DIRECT line-of-sight with the right earbud it will not work. Move the phone to left side of your head, it cuts out. Move it back to the right, it turns back on. Put it in your front breast/shirt pocket, completely cuts out. Put it in any shorts pocket (where it goes during a workout) does not work at all. Literally only works when holding the phone by the right earbud as if you're on a call, rendering these completely USELESS especially for working out. Also suffers from extreme body interference.  It doesn't even have to physically touch your leg, if the phone gets anywhere near your leg and/or body the signal is lost by the headphones.After contacting Bose and a lengthy explanation they were kind enough to send me a *brand new* replacement....which did the exact same thing out of the box. It was nice of them to replace them, too bad it was another worthless product/waste of money.Pros:-Sounds great (when they work)-Comfortable fitCons:-Bluetooth does not function, rendering them worthless-Does not work with phone in your pocket-CANNOT use during a workout-Does not work if streaming device (phone) touches your body in any way-Expensive for cheap components-May work just long enough to not get a refund when they die"
5	:	"I've only had them for two days, but I'm really happy I got them.  Read all the reviews of these and others, weighed the pros and cons. I was on the fence, knowing the sound quality of my old wired version and if I wanted to upgrade. But it comes down to this for those that had the wired sound sports before, of all headphones I've had, shure, etymonics, the Bose are the most comfortable.  They are not sound isolating, but they are fantastic for runs and long wear time.  That considered, and any difference in sound, these are so comfortable and the perfect step from my prior wired versions.  Might get the sound true for when I need quiet, but these are great and and fantastic (maybe not a good as my old shure's)."
2	:	"I love the sound.  I have other Bose products and I am a big Bose fan.  But these do not stay in the ear sufficiently on long runs.  They come with three different size earpieces and none work for me, although my wired Bose earbuds have never slipped once in the couple years I have had them.  Additionally- WOW the Bluetooth is weak!!!  Just google the Bluetooth problems with these headphones- it is even well documented on Bose??? support website.  The Bluetooth receiver is on the right side so if you phone/watch is on the left- good luck.  Good luck even if it was next to the right earbud!"
5	:	"I just got these in yesterday so I can???t write a great review YET.First, I can???t believe I spent $200 on a pair of headphones but I do use my headphones a LOT so I was able to justify the splurge.This is the first pair of ???high end??? headphones that I???ve bought so my experience is limited. I???m comparing mostly to LG HBS850.The first thing I noticed was how big the ear pieces are. They are pretty large and protrude out of your ears quite a bit. The LG ear piece is tiny in comparison(see image). I thought there would be no way the things were staying in my ears, however, they are MUCH more comfortable than the LG ear pieces. I didn???t even realize how uncomfortable the LGs were. The Bose ear piece doesn???t actually go inside your ear canal like the LG does.  With this type of earpiece, the Bose is not quite noise canceling(nor is it supposed to be).Some of the reviews say the Bose don???t get loud enough. Since they don???t actually go inside the ear canal and create a seal like the LGs and other internal earbuds do, it does seem like they don???t get quite as loud, however, they do get plenty loud. They just don???t get so loud that it hurts. If you want that, youu probably should go with the Beats.They connected to my iPhone 7 effortlessly. A mere click( we???ll more of a mushy push) of the power button and voila there it was on my phone.Then came the sound test. Oh my goodness!! They sound amazing. I can???t believe the difference in the sound quality between these and the LGs.It???s like the difference in monaural and stereophonic sound. The bass is very strong. I???m no techy person so I can???t really go into detail about how great the sound is but it is amazing.So that???s about all I can say for now. I will update more about the quality after I???ve used them for a while."
4	:	"Used these for over 2 months now.Sound: Good enough for me. Not a sound junkie. Block out a good enough noise but not all. You can hear wind while running outside.Connection: No issues with iPhone 6S, iPad Gen 3, and Macbook Pro.Fit: Fit in ears well when not exercising. Sweat makes them slip out a bit when I run. Only complaint.Battery: I think I get about 5-6 hours. Never use more than 1 hour at a time. Usually charge 1x a week.Phone calls: Clear. person on other end hears a lot of noise on my end.Overall: good headphones. $150 may be a little too much for these considering they slip out of my ears while running. May want to look else where if you plan to run in these."
1	:	"PROS These things are unbelievable don???t buy any other headset I have gone through so many, the quality is here the sound is here the base is here, all that you would want for beautiful sound and extremely comfortable they come with different sizes so you can choose whatever you like, it takes a minute to get used It, my fianc?? and I both love these in the battery life is excellent.HOWEVER the CONS  are I have had these for about a year now and use them just about every day and now the battery will not keep a full charge, it will charge but then within 10 min of use it goes from 100% to 20% then dies , so I haven???t looked into the warrenty but I have a feeling I am screwed, so if you don???t mind spending the money this is what  happened with mine."
3	:	"The sound quality is very good, but there was no way I could keep these snugly in my ears with any reasonable amount of movement. Tried all three sizes of the ear things, and none worked for me.I admittedly have an ear shape that is apparently hard to fit, so this issue probably doesn???t exist for most people.The main issue is the weight. The Bluetooth technology is housed in the earbuds themselves, which makes them fairly heavy...hence the issue.The search continued for good quality wireless earbuds that I can actually use. Until then, I???ll have to stick with my wired Bose earbuds."
2	:	"The Pros: I generally like Bose products. I'm not an audiophile, I just want to hear all the instruments along with a little thump, during workouts. I've never had issue with battery life and the connectivity to devices is slick and easy.Pet peeve: When losing contact with a device, the voice feedback feels the need to repeat the warning. It's not an airport, Bose. You don't need to get our attention. You're pumping sound directly into a person's ear-hole. 1 Warning is enough. We hear you the first time, every time. And it doesn't pause whatever it is it's interrupting, it just takes over. Mercifully, there's an on/off option for this feature. Unfortunately for me, I only discovered that fact yesterday.A ""Con"" that's a ""Pro"" for me: Other's don't like the Frankenstein's monster bolt aesthetic. I love it. It means people can see I'm wearing earbuds and cannot hear what they're saying. I even like the cable connecting the buds in this model. It allows me to rest the buds around my neck when I need to have them out for a longer spell.I don't love that the same-said Frankenstein's monster design is about as aerodynamic as an oil rig. It channels wind right into my ear and sounds like a category 4 hurricane. If I were riding faster, for longer periods of time, this would be a dealbreaker.Cons: The main problem is longevity. My first started to come apart after a year, or so. As a product built for sportspersons, it just seemed poorly manufactured, and even poorly engineered. The rubber bits housing the electronics failed exactly how one would expect... from a lesser product, not something in this price range.Bose was reasonably quick in responding to my customer service claim, but replacement pair has also begun to fail, after a month of use. The replacement also took around 2 weeks, from the time I returned the bud, 'till the time the new (almost certainly factory refurbished) phones arrived.After 6 weeks usage of the new pair, they have develop some king of signal noise in the left earbud. The real kicker is that the noise continues, even after the buds have been, ostensibly turned off. At first I literally thought my ear was malfunctioning, like there was water in it, or some such. BUt I was mistaken. The sounds were coming from INSIDE THE EARBUDS (RUN!), and indeed seemed to be associated with the electronics, because the buds would have zero power when I tired to use them the next day. So I'm girding my loins for another 2-week replacement odyssey.I think most people are willing to overpay because Bose simplifies things. We trade features and fidelity for calibration and ease-of-use. We don't, however, also expect to also trade ease for quality. This product gets a two-star rating because, in my admittedly limited experience, they are of a quality unacceptably low for a product at that price. If they were half the price, I'd still be pretty annoyed if they stopped working after a year.I think I'm probably done with Bose. I bought them to avoid this kind of drama."
3	:	"The ear-pieces, not the part that goes in the ear but the part outside of the ear is humongous and sticks out pretty far. Forget hats. Even bike helmets can be iffy - think it's a bad idea to wear headphones with a bike helmet, consider that I use them for navigation as well as pulse, wearing only the left earbud.The earbuds fit reasonably securely (I've run with them and they stayed put), but are less comfortable than the quietComfort20 earbuds (maybe because of the tug of my hair against these giant outside parts).Brand new, on a cool day (40-50F), they lasted 6 hours with rather soft music and constant heart-rate monitoring. Not great, but about as expected. For long hikes, I carry another pair of cheap headphones to wear once these are dead.Given the size of the outside part, the wind noise was less than what I had expected."
3	:	"I do a lot of research when i buy something. I look at reviews and product videos on youtube. Theres so much nowadays that allows us to look into items built. Ive had two sets of the Jaybird and they fell apart on me. I put the headphones through almost constant wear 5 days a week. I go biking with these types of headphones, jogging, working out. But those activities are generally short and to the point.I decided to give a go at the bose wireless headset. I liked the idea of it still giving ample sound bleeding in from the outside so that you can still hear everything going on while listening to whatever.They did well. I woulda said 5 stars. The sound quality was good. They fit decently. All functions worked appropriately. The bluetooth was fine.After several months the construction started falling apart. I know i put headphones through the rigors of my life and these seemed to last longer than the Jaybird ones, but i still take care of my equipment to the best of my ability. The strain relief was the first to go on the left side. It stayed like this for another handful of months. Then the sound kind of went. I am unsure as to why but i have them maxed out on both headset and phone and it is still barely audible sometimes. When i first turn something on it blares and then the suppressor kicks in dropping the sound. When i keep This also does it on my wireless speaker so this may not totally be the headset. I like to keep my volume just as the cusp of hearing it. I like the noise to be low but i think this is ridiculous.Next, after a couple of months later (So about a year of owning these) the rubber that is wrapped around each of the buds started to come loose. The button for power is just a free floating plastic piece (Unsure if it was actually attached at all to begin with) fell out as the rubber holding it in place loosened. Then this propagated into the half of the cover and the other side started to fall off as well. The next was the positive volume rubber  which i have a difficult time getting back into position.I have had three sets of bose wired headphones in the past. One set got me through my time in Afghanistan and still kept trucking through not only the remainder of my time in the Military but for several years after. They were falling apart and held together by electrical tape but still kept going. My soundsport headphones didnt last nearly as long but still i have them for at least two to three years. And my third set i am still using as my go to headphones when wired is acceptable.So these wireless soundsport are the headphones from Bose that have lasted me the smallest amount of time. They also are not the best headset to jog with, in my opinion, as they are a little on the heavy side and stick out pretty far. it was terrible though.This is just what happened to me.  Ive had them for about a year and three months. They are still working though i fear their water/sweat proofing is no longer valid. I keep using them and the sound isnt horrible (sill clear just quiet). So i think a solid three stars is worth it. Maybe its just wireless headsets that do not have the durability necessary for my life but hey, thats what reviews are for. Also note i didnt talk about the battery. The reason is because its just like any battery, it wears out overtime. The batteries in these are neither the best nor the worst. Pretty average in terms of battery usage. I still get a good handful of hours (about 5 maybe of non stop listening) though because i have to volume maxed out for most everything i do (this isnt excessively noisy things like aircraft or machine shops but isnt exactly quiet like a library).Cheers"
3	:	"The headphones sound great. I use the frequently not only for working out but also for phone calls, I have had great clarity both speaking and listening in on work calls while multitasking. I was worried about the earbud portion sitting well in my ear but found not only were they comfortable, but also stayed well positioned. I have to say they may be the most comfortable earbud I???ve ever had. The range on them is decent as well, I???ve definitely walked away from my phone and covered pretty good distances within my apartment 20ft+ with walls and doors in between and didn???t lose signal.My biggest gripe is the durability. After about 8 months the nose logo sticker on the sides of the earbud fell off and disappeared. After about a year of owning them the glue on any plastic/rubber/tpe piece has gotten really loose. The triangular rubber that holds the bud onto the inset of the earlobe started breaking after a little over a year. The microphone and volumer control button has become exposed and I???m worried about the buttons falling off. I???m worried about them breaking down further in rain or elements as all of the plastic rubber covering is literally falling apart.They are great headphones while they have lasted, but for $150+, I???d expect them to last a lot longer than a year. To be fair, they are still functional at a year and a half of use, but are falling apart and I worry that the next failure will be catastrophic."
2	:	"Growing up listening to a pair of 901 speakers I've always been partial to Bose. I also really appreciate a good set of earbuds, going through a handful over the years. A little over a year ago I started a quest for a new pair of listening devices, first going through various Samsung products but none were really to my liking. I also tried the Quietcontrol 30s but decided they weren't worth the high price so I settled with these. If you'd have asked me those first few months I'd say they were satisfactory, maybe a little pricey for the sound quality. Talking over Bluetooth was not good at all, the headphones that came with my phone far surpassed these for phone calls. Battery life was also lower than what I expected- 4 hours maybe. This wasn't a dealbreaker since I was able to charge them every few days. I really just wanted them for the main function of listening so I was OK with the battery and call quality. About 6 months in they started breaking down. First I noticed the rubber surrounding the buttons was expanding causing me to have to press a little harder to pause, change songs, etc. I also noticed the battery would only get up to 80% capacity even after leaving plugged in overnight. Then the rubber surrounding the buds loosened and fell off with the rubber buttons only getting harder and harder to press. Finally last week the left bud stopped working. I'm technically still in the warranty period but I'm moving on to greener pastures."
2	:	"Bought these new on Amazon. After charging my new SoundSports, I attempted to pair to my iPhone 6 Plus. My phone, which has successfully paired to many other Bluetooth devices, does not see the SoundSports headphones unless I reboot my phone first. Really annoying. Sending them back for a refund."
5	:	"First off let me give you an idea on how often I use these. Everyday for at least 3 to 6 hours. So I???m constantly pressing the pause/play button. That being said, This is now my second pair of these headphones. I only have two qualms; first the rubber around the volume/next button wears out and there???s no way to fix it (I tried crazy glue). Second, the actual Bluetooth range is maybe 10 ft. I have a very small house, only 900sqft, And placing the phone in the center of the house didn???t work either. Even with those two qualms I can???t give these a bad review because I love these wireless headphone. Bose has always delivered exceptional sound quality!  If you like them as much as me buying a second or third pair doesn???t seem so bad. Bose has spoiled me so the $20 version of these won???t do!"
3	:	"Sound quality is great and they stay firmly in my ears when working out or doing strenuous activity.  That being said.  I have been have issues with the bluetooth connectivity.  My phone could be in my pocket, 3 feet away, and since its not a direct line of sight, it either drops the connection or is very patchy in the sound.  I have had them for a year now and the rubber surrounding the right ear piece (the one with the charging port) is coming off, which means that the small plastic pieces inside that allow you to actually push the power/options button, falls out.  Also, the rubber on the volume up/down has expanded and come out of the plastic housing and once again, the small plastic pieces that allow you to adjust the volume have fallen out.  I have to adjust the volume from the device I am connected to."
2	:	"The sound quality, like most of the Bose headphones(4) that I have owned over the years, is of a very good quality. Nice range. But I have two reasons for rating this device so low, one minor, one major. First, the minor reason. None of the in-ear headphones fits very well in my ear. I try all the available sizes and it still fits poorly. Who knows... maybe it???s MY ears. But the major reason that Bose pisses me off is that the in-ear earbuds that I???ve owned (3 of the 4 Bose headphones mentioned above) are of a poor quality of construction. I mean, the build quality is just lousy. The volume buttons stop working; wire connections shred and stop working; Bluetooth (in these SoundSports) stops working. I???m just very tired of paying a lot for Bose audio products and they just... don???t... last... long. It???s not worth it. Henceforth, I will try other manufacturers. The QC15 that I have still seem to work okay but, of course, I only use these on trips so they don???t get the same amount of usage. If they did, I???m guessing that they???d be broken by now!!!"
5	:	"If you are looking for a wireless headphone to use while you work out or running, stop searching further. This is it. Just for context, I own a Bose QC 35 II, a Beats 3 and a couple of other in-ear head phones.  While the larger over ear headphones like the QC35 and the Beats 3 provide excellent sound quality and noise cancellation, if feel like they are big to wear, specially while working out. Some times they slide of your head while doing a bench press. The Beats is my least favorite because of the pressure it creates on my skin. When using other in hear headphones, I can still hear outside noise and the overall sound quality is average. The Bose SoundSport stands heads and shoulder above any in-ear headphones I've used in terms of audio quality. Even though noise cancellation is not a product feature, because of how these headphone sit inside your ear, they effectively block out all outside noise. They are very comfortable to wear - they come with 3 adapters that you can choose from to suit the size of you ear opening. So, it is not a one size fits all scenario.  The sweat absorption is superb and it stays securely fit at all times. The charging levels last me for at least 3 gym sessions of 2 hour each and I still have some left for a weekend run. So, very practical as well. I absolutely love this headphone and is my preferred one to use when it comes to working out."
3	:	We are having to exchange the set we bought. They have a short in them somewhere and one bud goes in and out. They haven't even been used a whole month and they are having problems. I hope this is just a fluke because the husband really likes them.I bought these on advice from my son for my husbands Christmas gift. After opening them he tried them out and said they block out the outside sounds better than our gun range ear protection. He runs every morning and we have been looking for a decent pair of wireless head ear buds for working out. He came back from his run today and said the are great. They are comfortable and don???t fall out plus they have really good sound. He wants to get me a pair but I am skeptical they will fit my tiny ears but I will give it a try. If  I like you them as much as he does I will be back to buy another set.The hubby???s is still working good and I bought a set as well. I love them. I have teeny tiny ears and I can still use them. Sound is great. The only thing I don???t like about them is that they don???t have a locator. Other than that no complaints at all.
4	:	"I splurged in the Bose SoundSport Wireless headphones after performing a lot of research on other models.I own the wired version which I love. I have smaller ears and found that many others were unbearable to wear after a short period of time.After purchasing the iPhone X I found the hassle of using the adapter to be annoying. In the end it was a blessing in disguise because when I exercise ( whether it be at the gym or on walks) the convenience of the wireless model is worthwhile. I can easily adjust the volume or answer phone calls with the control near my right ear.Also, being wire free is pretty great. Battery life so far has been really good. I use them in 1-2 hour blocks and they lose approximately 10% of their charge with each use.Another nice thing is that when you turn it on the headphones will tell you how much battery life is left.In researching other wireless headphone options I encountered many reviews where the other headphones would no longer hold an adequate charge for after months of use.I was able to purchase a 4 year Square Trade warranty for these headphones for only a little over $11.  That sealed the deal for me.I do admit that these are not as comfortable as the wired type (the receiver is in the earpiece so it is heavier than its wired version). My ears do ache a bit around the 2 hour mark. But as I mentioned before I have small ears (I use the smallest ear piece) so I???m not sure if that is a factor.I find the quality of the sound to be more than acceptable. I mainly listen to podcasts on my walks or stream movies while doing the elliptical. Haven???t tried to stream music yet but I???m pretty sure it will satisfy my needs.These are an investment compared to some other models but I truly believe that sometimes it???s worth paying more money for a quality product rather than having to replace other models more frequently."
2	:	"I am really dissapointed in this one! As always Bose as great sounding products (please dont see this and think I don't like your products!) I have bought there QC-25, and 4 corded soundsports for friends and family. I sweat alot when i run and excess sweat was getting to my phone so I wanted  bluetooth sport headphones with good sound quality. Here's the problem. Bose made quality product but they are massive. Like dont go into your ear and the body of the headphone sticks out like an 1-1.5 inches. They make me look goofy and my ears feel heavy and bounce around when I run!  If they could make them the same size as other running products I would totally purchase it, but I have no idea how this got through product testing.... Ugh gotta wait until Bose comes out with a smaller product. Until then I will be continuely frustrated with non-sweat proof sport headphones from there competition!"
3	:	"I bought the headphones just over a year ago, since a couple of weeks ago, when running I was able to hear some static noise just for a brief while.Today with a charge of 40%, the earphones started emitting a high pitched buzz, even after I turned off the earphones it still could be heard.Watch out with the Play/Skip/Rewind button, after some months it stopped responding  to gentle presses and required more pressure to properly work. Also the volume down button was difficult to press, I guess the inner rubber contact mask displaced,My next steps are going to be:Let the battery drain so the phones can completely reset and see if the noise continues.I was able to get a recording of the high pitched sound and attached as a video.Edit 1:The headphones are dead, they don't even turn on now :(Edit 2:Got in touch with Bose and they answered promptly, after running some more tests I was asked to return the unit and I received a new one completely free of charge. Kudos to the Bose Support team. Changing my review to 3 stars due to the fact that the new unit works perfectly and the controls feel a lot more solid than the previous ones. Will update again after 6 months of use on the new unit.Cheers"
5	:	"It is late April 2018; I bought these early July 2017 and have used them heavily while doing renovation work on my house. Very sweaty, very active work.The earpiece design is excellent. It has a silicone tab that hooks into the fold of your ear, so these headphones never fall out. I have very small ear canals, and always have problems with most bud-style headphones.There is a little clip attached to the cord, which allows you to clip the headphones to your collar to secure them. My shirt kept shifting around, so it would tug on the ear pieces, so I never used the clip, but I imagine it???s a nice feature for certain activities.The materials are all very nice quality; the cord is flexible, there is a cover on the charging port.The earpieces do stick out quite far from your head; a little goofy looking.I use the provided storage case; it???s exactly as big as it needs to be and no bigger. Comes with a carabiner to hang on your gym bag or whatever.Actual battery life is probably about 4 hours with the volume cranked high.  I haven???t done an exact test on this, but I know I can???t  go a whole workday without charging. Maybe I should turn the volume down.These are not noise cancelling, but they do s pretty good job of blocking noise anyway.They charge quickly, and they pair with my iPhone instantly.  Bluetooth connection is perfect up to about 30 feet through walls, and a bit better line-of -sight. I always have my phone nearby for changing songs anyway.The reason I am taking time to write this review is that I just had a perfect customer service experience.I was listening to the headphones a few weeks ago when they simply shut down (made the shutdown sound in my ear) in the middle of a song. The battery had been pretty full when I turned them on 30 minutes earlier. What had happened was something like an instant battery drain.  I plugged them in to charge, and got a red error light. Long story short, I fiddled and fiddled, got it to give me a blinking amber light which means charging, but it never stopped blinking for days. I could get them to turn on; my phone couldn???t see the Bluetooth connection, nothing. I dug around on the internet and found how to update the firmware. No fix. Dug around some more, turns out this was a common problem with pre-August 2017 Sound Sports.So I called the Bose 800 number and was told all representatives are busy; we will call you back yadayada???- by the time they called back 48 hours later, I had already gotten taken care of by using their online chat feature. I simply typed out a long paragraph laying out all the symptoms and everything I had tried. I waited a few seconds, and the chat agent said, ??? thanks for the detailed explanation. We???d like to replace your headphones with a new pair.???  That easy. No baloney. They sent me a return slip and paid UPS label. I shipped it off and got my replacement in about a week. Amazing."
5	:	"I have been looking for headphones that I can wear working out that still sound good, and are comfortable for taking walks, yard work, etc... and these are it.  To me the sound is very very good.  Most headphones like these...(to my ears..and we are all different...) have a solid midrange and bass which I just could not find in other sports type headphones.  Having said that...these were also substantially more expensive than other headphones I have bought in the past...Koss KSC75 --over ear with surprising good sound for the price!!, but not the deep bass like the Bose, AfterShokz Trekz Titanium Open Ear Wireless Bone Conduction Headphones---no real bass to speak of...but cool idea, gave them to my wife, 1MORE Triple Driver In-Ear Headphones--pretty good sound, again, to that rich sound like the bose, and not comfortable for my ears, 66 Audio BTS+....pretty nice actually, but poor Bluetooth strength and battery life...and again...didn't sound as good as the bose."
5	:	"My review is going to be brief for now but this was one of the best audio-related purchases I've made in recent years. I was having a hard time deciding between the Jaybird X3s and the Bose SoundSports but I'm glad I went with the SoundSports instead. The battery life on the X3s is one hour better than the SoundSports however ability to charge the SoundSports with any micro-USB cable is a huge plus. I don't have to worry about remembering to bring an adapter everywhere I goAs for sound, these definitely have the quality I've come to expect from Bose. I have some very expensive Sennheiser open and closed over-ear headphones at home (that cost $250 or more) and while the SoundSports may not sound as good as those I was very impressed at the audio quality with them being wireless.I decided to include a SquareTrade 4-year warranty when I purchased these due to some of the durability concerns I've seen so only time will tell how they fare in that regard."
5	:	So my last pair of headphones were the Beats 2. They fit well and the sound was ok but they broke three times. The ear bud snapped off from the housing. They refused to fix the third time so I went to Bose since I always had good over the hear headphones from them. Have not been disappointed. Sound is much better than beats. The charging case is perfect for traveling. The app always informs on battery level and takes heart rate if you are into using them for working out. They fit great in ear and dont fall out. Batter last about three hours longer than Beats. Totally recommend.
3	:	"Pros:- Sound quality is good- Very comfortable- Easy volume control, pause/play.I listen to audio books at the gym and while biking and enjoy the comfort and sound quality.Cons:- No volume control for the turn on message ""BATTERY AT X PERCENT, CONNECTED TO Y DEVICE"" screaming in my ear at max volume- No rewind function. I have another bluetooth headphone w/ a forward/reverse button, I really wish these had that. Only pause/play and vol controls. No way to skip back 30s like the other brand headphones.- After a few months of moderate use, they are coming apart at the seams. Both the volume button and the power button are coming apart... power button is peeling off, volume button is cracking open. I might try to epoxy the power back down, but there's no way to fix the volume button."
2	:	"Good:- Connectivity is solid. Much better than similar Jaybirds and Beats.- Sound is slightly above average Beats, way way way higher than Jaybirds.- Carrying case is small and zippered, unlike competitors that have embarrassingly large and useless cases (Jaybird) or open and rubbery cases (Beats)Bad:- Extremely loud and annoying beeps every time you connect or reach max volume. The Bose Connect app lets you turn off annoying voice feedback but the beeps remain.- The fit is terrible -- much worse than competitors. This is in part due to the extra bulk of the headphones. But it could've been solved with offering customers more sizes for the rubber inserts. Right now, there's a huge jump between medium and large sizes so there's no real way to get a good fit that doesn't leak a ton. Both my girlfriend and my brother can't use this for the exact same reason -- so I know it's not just my idiosyncratic ears."
5	:	"I have had the headphones over six months now and i love them, they have great sound and they fit my ears really well and there is no irritation even after all day use. I am currently on my second pair after my other pair went nuclear, I answered the phone one day with the headphones and they went haywire. I had what sounded like Morris code in my left ear and they refused to charge. I contacted Bose, by email, and after 24hrs i received a response. I tried all of their recommendations for fixes and none of them worked so they sent me a new pair. All of this took about a week. Their customer service was excellent.The only complaint that i have is the clip that attaches to your shirt, which is extremely necessary if you do not have both earpieces in, is easy to loose. I have already lost the new one i got a month ago. It really needs to be permanently attached to the headphones some how.I have had other brands of wireless headphones before and they have all fallen apart after a year (literally fallen apart). The Bose headphones have been able to handle my work environment,contractor and house remodel-or, with little to no problem."
2	:	"Puts out good sound quality, battery life is better than average for these types of headphones, comfortable design, and no apparent issues with exposure to moisture.However, these started falling apart after 4 months of regular use and by 9 months they were close to unusable. First the logo just fell off. Then the covering on each ear bud started coming loose. Then the covering to the control button came loose, which upset the configuration to the point where pause/play and the button to reduce sound stopped working. The button for sound increase also stopped working unless you dug around with your fingernail at random. Then the volume control kept malfunctioning entirely so the volume would randomly go from max to mute to split your eardrums max volume again.To top it off, the company???s stellar warranty, even with serial numbers, won???t back a return if purchased through amazon (even though it was a direct purchase)."
5	:	"I've owned or tried about a dozen different bluetooth earbuds, and this Bose product is the best sounding by a huge margin.  I've been a part-time musician for several decades in addition to doing vintage instrument restorations; I also own specialized sound equipment and am pretty particular (probably to a fault!) about  all sound reproduction equipment.In my opinion these earbuds have the most clear, balanced response of any I have tried.  They work especially well with any unit that has multi-band equalization or even simple tone controls.  the treble response is never harsh; the mids are clear without any sort of ""honk"" or hollowness; and there is a ton of bass on tap - *if* you want it.  The bass is never overpowering - Ive tried it with iPhones, Android devices, Macs, PC's and other gear, including  a couple of sub-$10 mp3 players and it worked well with all of them. The sound quality reflects the quality of whatever is driving them, although it improves the sound of cheaper mp3 (and similar) players more than other higher-end units I've tried.And there's one other feature that I found totally surprising - I generally get from 8-12 hours or use listening to music, watching videos etc out of a charge.  I've never found anything else that worked for more than 6 or 7 hours.  I also like the fact that they shut off if they aren't receiving any input for about 10 minutes or so (I haven't timed it).They come with 3 different size earpieces.  The medium ones fit me just fine and seem secure - I can't really judge them as far as use for exercise as I don't use them that way.I don't normally write long, detailed reviews about anything - but I feel this Bose product is SO good - and more than worth the price - that I felt it important enough to review."
4	:	"Ok, they are Bose so my expectations were high.  If you use the correct size of bud and make sure there is a seal between the bud and your ear canal is good, the bass is the best of any of the wired and Bluetooth earphones I tried.  Nevertheless, the treble is tinny and makes these good for listening to music while doing other things but not great for dedicated sessions.  The in-line Mic is phenomenal however, making taking calls while out on walks a real possibility.  Keep in mind that sealing the buds properly really cuts down on ambient noise.  I keep the volume low so I can be sure to hear approaching cars when I'm walking.  They do seem to be well-sealed from moisture but the rubber cover for the charger is a pain to open and close and since I get only about three hours of use per charge, I have to open and close it a lot."
5	:	"Let me say that I love these headphones. I was buying a few different headphones with a different brand and while I enjoyed them very much, they weren't very durable and ended up as useless trinkets in my desk drawer.  So far these Bose SoundSport headphones have done everything I need them to do but with one flaw, which may in fact be a flaw of all wireless headphones.  When I'm talking on the phone, the person on the other end can find it difficult to hear me because the background noise seems amplified more than my voice.  I've experienced this before with different headphones paired with different phones so maybe it's a general incompatibility.  Maybe it has something to do with how the noise canceling works.  I don't know.  But aside from that, these are great!"
1	:	"I have been using the SoundSport for 10 months on and off now and they are already falling appart. I would say that the use I have put on these unit has been low, and the rubber on both the right and left ear bud is already detaching from the harder plactic peice. Also, the rubber covering the control has separated from the body of the control. The buttons were always a little spongy, but now the volume down button is almost unusable with out moving the rubber cover into just the right alignment with both hands.  the sound quality on the unit is great but I'm very disappointed with the material qulity. For the price I paid for the unit I expect a lot more when it comes to a product made by bose."
2	:	"I had these for a little over 24-36 hours now.  I bought them because the cyber monday deal was too good to be true and the reviews were on the 4 star or higher side.First off, the sound is smh... just ok.  you don???t really get the bass you would expect from a well established brand like Bose.  I have bought multiple non branded earbuds on amazon ($20 or less) that are much better sounding and have DOUBLE the battery life.  I think I will keep those handy in case these Bose Sound Sports fail me in a month or so as other reviews have pointed out.Secondly, the way it fits is terrible!!  I use these for both working out and my metro train commute to and from work.  I have to keep the volume at a very high level (which in turn kills my battery quicker) just so I don???t have to hear the ventilation system and doors open/ close.  I wish the ear plugs could create a tighter fit and prevent air from going in (which is where the source of sound waves come from), but in stead, it just rests on the brim of your ear and can???t be placed deeper to create a nice tight seal.Battery life is ok.  Wireless/ bluetooth headphones have been around for years now.  6 hrs of play time is old news.  You would think Bose had come up with something along the lines of 8-12 hours like other no name brand headphones or like the PowerBeats 2.I haven???t done a truly long workout yet where i had a lot of sweat, but once that happens a few time, I will be sure to update this review depending on how ???sweat resistant??? they are.  Multiple reviews have stated poor quality when it comes to being sweat/ water resistant, so i highly recommend getting the square trade protection plan.Third and lastly,  the control and mic seem very cheaply made.  it takes some getting use to and knowing if you???ve really pressed the volumes/ middle keys correctly.  It feels loose and poorly engineered in design.  Again, for a top brand like Bose, I was expecting something much better.Update:  12/13/18so far, all of the pros and cons are the same as my review above described.  the only thing I beginning to notice is the battery life is deceiving.  When i first start using them, it stays at 100% for a good hour until it drops to 90.  so, in my head I???m thinking ???ok, these may last 10 hours at this rate???.  nope!!  watch out, once you get to 80%, battery life will die much faster.  i worked out for 2 hours with battery life starting at 80%, after 2 hour, it was down to 20%... 60% in one hour?!?  unacceptable!!"
3	:	"Bought these 5mos ago and gave an initial 5 ??? rating. Mostly for sound. Bose has superior sound no two ways about it.What Bose does not have is the ability to build a pair of head phones that last longer than 6mos. This is the 2nd pair (last pair was wired) of head phones from Bose that I've paid at least $100 for to take a dump on me within the 1st 6mos of use.The rubber around the right earbud separated from the hard plastic housing, causing the power button to no longer turn off the unit.The play button on the in-line control, squishy at best to start with, became completely useless. Also the molding cup on the left earbud wire, where the wire enters the speaker housing came loose and slipped down the wire. ANNOYING!The clothing clip, which they only provide one, broke within the 1st 2wks. Then they expect you to pay another $12 for a replacement!For $149.00 before tax or S&H this is completely unacceptable. Bose should do better.While I'd like to NOT recommend these, I cannot. The sound, comfort of fit and ability to remain in-ear no matter what, makes up for the other short comings.I do however recommend the purchase of the Asurion 4yr protection plan for another $12. Trust me, it will come in handy! Just filed a claim yesterday, and will receive my new pair today! All thanks to Asurion, not Bose, mind."
4	:	"Well, first off I'm not an audiophile by any means. I only know what sounds good to me, but I don't know the specific terminology for describing the sound. That being said, these headphones are a great purchase, with a few caveats.Comfort 4/5:For being earbuds, these are probably the most comfortable buds I've ever owned. They. Do. Not. Move. Which was my concern when first looking into headphones for working out. That being said, maybe my ears are oddly shaped, but after about an hour of wearing them, I will notice some discomfort. But - since these (for me) are for working out and riding to and from work, that's not a big issue. Don't expect the same comfort you would get from overear headphones (I have Sennheiser's HD598s and those are hands down the most comfortable headphones I've ever had).Sound Quality 5/5:Like I said, I'm no expert. I only know what sounds good. I like the sound that I get from these headphones but I'm sure someone more qualified than me could pick them apart. Normally with bluetooth headphones, I expect to hear a drop in audio quality - not the case with these.Technical Issues 4/5:I have noted some audio dropping in the gym, which may be due to a high RF environment (or maybe not, again - not an expert) from other bluetooth headsets. It's not constant but it will happen 2-3 times in an hour work out, lasting for about 2-3 seconds each time. Oddly enough, my iphone 7 screen will go black and will not be accessible during these black out periods. This does not repeat outside of the gym - so I'm not sure what to make of this. Might not even be the fault of the headphones. It's not a deal breaker for me though.Overall 5/5:The microphone is apparently pretty dang good, based on my wife's opinion when I call her from it. Not a feature I was looking for in these headphones, but I'm glad I have it. Makes the driving home hands free a breeze, being able to answer or end calls from the in-line controls. Sound quality is excellent, comfort is pretty good, and the fact these earbuds do not move is astounding to me. Every single pair of earbuds I've ever owned have fallen out while working out at some point. They charge quickly and last for at least several days of workouts/driving to & from work. Yes, there are some minor issues that detracted from the categories above, but hopefully I've emphasized how minor those issues are to me.In conclusion, I highly recommend these earbuds. They do everything I need them to do well. If you're looking for some headphones for working out, this is it."
5	:	"These headphones sound really good considering they are wireless, the bass reproduction is fantastic compared to other in-ear wireless earphones. The hardware layout is similar to other Bose products, all manual controls are on the right side, which is great if you're already accustomed to Bose. Unfortunately these do not have noise isolation or noise cancelling. Although the StayHear gel plugs have no guarantee of noise isolation they are very comfortable and stay stationary in your ear. The product itself doesn't come with a charging case which is available for another 50 dollars, so you'd need to make sure these are charged before going out for your day. These headphones support the standard (and universal) USB Type Micro-B charging.These awesome earphones can also be paired with Bose Connect mobile app which can update the earphones to the latest firmware. But what I love the most is that the app works with other Bose products as well, such as the Bose QuietComfort 35. Unlike the Apple owned Beats brand, these headphones support reporting of battery level with supported Android devices and voice prompt of the battery during boot of the earphones. These earphones also support the AAC codec which can provide high quality audio with Apple and Android devices (if supported). If there are bluetooth inconsistencies a quick-fire way of fixing this issue would be to clear and re-pair both devices, fortunately these earphones rock an NFC pairing tag.If you're concerned about looks... Well, these headphones are quite big but not ugly, definitely still comfortable."
5	:	"This is my 3rd try at some decent running/working out headphones. I originally bought Plantronics waterproof at Costco and I just couldn't really hear above the other noises in the gym. The product wouldn't go loud enough. Returned those to Costco and bought Jayhawks bluetooth when they were $50 off. Those sounded tweetish even with all the different sound modes on the app, it hurt my ears, returned them. We have Bose speakers/home theater system so I decided to try the wireless Soundsport headphones. What a relief! They are loud enough, they have clear sound with adequate bass. They are not noise cancelling, but I don't hear anything else when I'm at the gym. They do the job very well with all kinds of music. I am happy!"
5	:	"These headphones are (almost) absolutely perfect. They sound better than my Jaybirds BlueBuds X and my old wired pair of Bose headphones. They are SUPER comfortable. Easy to use. They're super light in my ear and I never worry about them falling out. The SoundTrue tips from my old Bose headphones fit and worked perfectly, but made the sound a bit tinny, which is fine because I found these new SoundSport tips that came with the headphones to be more comfortable and sound better, but they do block out more noise. They aren't noise cancelling but don't expect to be able to have a conversation while wearing these. The wire is a bit thin so time will tell how it'll be hold up to wear and tear, and the volume/play buttons are a bit mushy, which isn't a complaint, I just prefer something more clicky. I'm guessing it's mushy because it's rubber for the water resistance. My biggest complaint, which is still a small one, is that the 6 hour battery life seems a bit short. They probably would've had to do something like the LG Tones do for more battery, so I'm okay with how they did it.All in all, I'm VERY happy with these. The thing that matters most is that they sound good, and they sound amazing."
2	:	"This product does not stay in my ear and keep falling out with the least movement. My ears are very average and normal shape.lolSo I cannot say much good as the product falls out of my ear even when using their smallest ear piece which is still rather large. I am very sad because it???s a very expensive product, in my opinion,  and it should stay in my ear. The piece that came on it for the ear was enormous and it would fall out immediately but I swapped it for the smallest ear piece in the box and it too was huge. After swapping out the pieces, the same thing happened, it too fell out of my ear.  I think our ears were assumed to be large.The size of the earpiece disappointed me as the developers didn???t take this into consideration. I may send the product back as it???s useless if I can???t place them in my ear and they not fall out. Maybe I need the on the ear type as they look big and awkward but until a developer offers something smaller maybe similar to a hearing aid it???s not going to work. Correction: the charging orange light does comes on when the ear plugs are plugged into ???YOUR???  wall adapter ( as this product does not come with a wall adapter/ only a USB that???s a few inches long), however when u attempt to charge the plugs into a PC usb port, the  orange light does not come on or show you are charging.I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN."
4	:	"Headphones provide very good sound quality.  The bluetooth link to my computer usually maintains a decent connection even when out of line-of-sight. The only real complaint I have is that the rubber ear inserts begin to hurt my ears after an hour. Otherwise, I would rate them 5 stars.Problem: I ordered the Bose SoundSports on December 6, 2016, and toward the end of October the rubber seal that covers the on/off switch and usb charging port pulled away from the headphone. Consequently, I was unable to turn the headphones off or on without pulling the rubber seal out of the way to depress the on/off switch.Bose Customer Support: On November 6, 2017 I contact Bose customer support and the rep stated that they would replace my expensive headphones free of charge, shipping label to be sent, and I will return the defective headphones to Bose. Once they receive the headphones, the new replacement will be sent to me.Problem Solved: Since I had the headphones under a year, I was hopeful that I could get a replacement and Bose did not disappoint. Thank you, Bose. Excellent support."
4	:	"I have ordered a number of earbuds and these by far sound the best to date. I chose to try these out after losing my QC35s headphone.Granted, they are very large in size and it takes awhile to get used to them. My kids, 13 and 15 y.o. do not favor the appearance.I forgive the appearance and lean heavily toward a better sound. Bose typical full range sound without high or lows being too pronounced.I was worried about the type of sound coming from such a small device. I wasn't disappointed after trying them.I have was spoiled with my Bose's QC35 headphones' battery life which lasts for days under heavy use and their noise cancelation. I missed it.The batteries drain down to 60% after 2-3 hours. My guess is they last about 8 - 10 hours."
2	:	"I am not a happy customer. I bought my Soundsport Pulse in February 2017 and for a while I loved them. Sound quality is really good for a pair of Bluetooth headphones and the fit is really comfortable. I also use the heart rate monitoring function quite often with the Under Armor app.Unfortunately, the build quality is just horrible. Within 11 months, the remote's buttons had popped out and it became very difficult to use it, so I requested a warranty replacement. The replacement went smoothly, but the new unit that I got back had the same thing happen to them within 5 months! I am also having the case on the right earphone popping off.So, regardless of the sound quality, I just can't recommend a product that costs more than $100 and just can't last even a year."
4	:	"These headphones are outstanding. I upgraded from my other Bose headphones (with the connection wire) when my phone's headphone jack broke and I could not be more pleased with the results. In addition to the convenience of being wireless, these do a better job of blocking out outside noises - a huge issue for me as a commuter on noisey public transit.I docked one star only because of the battery length. The headphones alert you what the % of battery is left, which is helpful, but I don't think the 6 hours is very long, especially for travelers.It arrives in a pretty swanky box, adjustable ear inserts of various sizes, a carrying case, and suggests you download a mobile app for various connectivity benefits. I am unsure of what those are at the moment, but did so in the event of software updates (Don't want to get burned in the future!), Which took 20 minutes, but was very easy."
3	:	"I'd have to agree with a lot of more detailed reviewers: Sound is awesome, bass is not overpowering but does leave you wanting more volume. Fit was fine for me but did note the cable tends to pull to the side of the controller (right)...fixed by using the clip at the back of your shirt. I returned mine due to the choppy BT signal (while jogging/running) when pulling my iPod Nano out of my pocket. Just that short distance caused the spotty BT connection until returned to my pocket. I expected better from Bose. So until a more solid wireless BT product comes to market, I'll continue to use my ""wired"" Bose headphones."
4	:	"These are definitely far more comfortable than the Jaybird X2 I purchased them to replace. The silicone is soft, fits nicely in my ear, and stays put for the duration of my workouts. Although it is not featured in any of the photos, nor mentioned in the manufacturer info, there is a small clip that's attached to the cord and allows you to connect it to your shirt. This keeps the cord centered, and prevents an excess of cord on either side from pulling the ear piece. This tiny feature is worth its weight in gold.The only problem I have with the SoundSport wireless is the power button. It is extremely finicky, and often I'm unable to turn it on and off on the first attempt. Beyond that one annoyance, these are my favorite headphones for working out. The sound is good, they don't let in much ambient noise (considering they are not intended to block incoming noise), and are really, really comfortable. I recommend them!Just remember to charge them between workouts and you'll be pleased. I can get through almost 100 miles of cycling on the same charge."
5	:	"I've worn these headphones at the gym for up to 4 hours at a time and they cause no ear fatigue at all. I attribute this to the fact that they do not go very far into your ear canal, but rather rest on the outside of it. The special winglet wedges itself into your ear and will not move around. I've lifted weights, biked aggressively, and run multiple miles at a time without these headphones moving at all.The sound quality is great compared to other ""sport"" headphones I've used. Very clear vocals and decent base.The battery life is better than is stated by Bose. 3 hours of constant use on mine only lowers the battery to 80% (according to the Bose app).The pairing, as with all other Bose products i've tried, was extremely easy for the iPhone SE. You do it once and never have to mess with it again.However, these headphones will NOT block out ambient noise at all. Since they do not go very far into your ear canal, you'll still be able to hear 20-30% of the noise around you (especially at a crowded gym). I like this though, since it allows me to still be aware of my surroundings.Overall: these headphones fit amazingly, don't cause my ears to hurt during/after prolonged use, have better than advertised battery life, have excellent sound quality, and are solidly built. Totally worth the $150.00 and would recommend to friends/family."
5	:	"Easy to setup, apps work great, auto firmware update worked just fine.  I'm an ""audiophile"" and the $39 set of wireless waterproof bt earbuds were just *terrible* so I decided to fetch these (and return the others).  The Bose pair have the added advantage of heart rate monitor, which is perfect for me on my bike commute to work (although there's a saftey concern of not hearing what's around you, so I will likely keep the volume down).Overall have been listening for an hour and am really enjoying this even at my desk (instead of my $600 headphone amp plus magnaplanar headphones).  Lots of detail, lots of bass, and pretty good sound for in ear monitors.  Impressed.Highly recommended thus far."
5	:	"Summery:The thing I love about Bose products is they don't compromise on quality. There are no junk Bose products and these headphones are no exemption but don't kid yourself you pay for that quality. I'm sure there are better (or as good) headphones on the market at a better price but you'll end up spending more buying different ones until you find the perfect ones. Just buy these and be done with it.Pros: - The bass, my god the bass is so deep and high quality. - Bose does all sorts of magic to make them sound great - Heres one I didn't expect, the app is great. They didn't try and add links to facebook or other BS you don't want or need. The app updates and controls the buds. Also has some cool share music with feature but I haven't tried it. - My ears are dysfunctional and none of the apple ones (or any other buds I've tried) will stay in my ears. These do, I can goto the gym, run or lift and they stay put. - Super comfortable. The three ear inserts will get you the right size so you can wear them all day. - Did I mention the bass and sound quality is 10/10Cons: - Battery life. It's adequate, I can get thru a day no problem but you're gonna have to charge it all the time. Welcome to our modern world of charging everything every night. The price we pay for cutting the cord. - Bose...Why didn't you USB-C so I don't have to fight to charge the darn things.Just buy them you will not regret it.Picture: My good old QC15's are still kicking and I love them too"
2	:	"The Bose style in-ear tips are the most comfortable I've ever found -- Not the round tips you cram into your ears like other brands.  These are oval shaped like your ear canal and rest in place without causing ear fatigue.  For this reason, I've been buying Bose in-ear headsets for over 10 years (back then you pretty much got them at a Bose store or the airport) trying most of the new models as they came out and following that progression to these wireless headphones.Like many other reviews, I have issues with the battery.  I plug in the headset to charge, the next day the green light on the headset is on which indicates that it has a full charge.  Turning on the headset from this full charge state, I have had the headphones report the battery was 90% and 80%.  ... so it lost 10-20% of its charge in the 30 seconds from unplugging it from the charger and putting them in my ears.Not that the percentage is accurate anyways -- It has reported 40% charge and then 15 minutes later reported that it needed to be charged.  It's gone from 100% to 50% in one hour.  You really have no idea how long they are going to last."
1	:	"For those - like myself - who are now looking to buy a premium pair of sports in-ears, don't waste your time on these. Bose should be absolutely ashamed that they dare offer a product like this at all. For roughly $160 including NYC taxes you get a pair of totally mediocre headphones that fall apart the second you unbox them. It's actually shocking how poorly constructed these are... See the photos, all the controls are literally falling apart! And no, I don't abuse them at all by any standards. I do blame myself for waiting too long to go back to the Bose store at Columbus Circle where I bought them, because of course, by the time they got to being useless (I can't switch them on anymore, the power button has literally fallen off!!), I'm a few weeks over my 1-year warranty period. A total sham. And that includes the store, which is operated by people who really couldn't care less. I read the EU has a 2-year warranty period, are they made up to higher standards there?! Bose: a sad excuse for a premium brand imho"
4	:	"Pros:*Good sound - Seem balanced to my ears, and I???ve been called fussy.*Comfortable - almost as though they aren???t there.*Secure - Ran 4 miles, got sweaty, and the headphones didnt move around.*Adequate battery life - 3 hours took them down to 40% battery*Seem well-built*Intuitive controls*Was told my voice came through clearly on multiple callsCons:*Wish isolation was better.*Comply does not make replacement tips*Not inexpensive (but they are good)*Kind of big - others can???t miss seeing them if I???m wearing them!Needed a pair to go running with and to use at work and around the house.  Will never be confused with my Sennheiser HD650 or other full-sizes cans (or even my nice Audio Technica earphones), for sound quality, but a very pleasant and accessible sound signature.  I like them a lot!"
2	:	"Lost my Jaybird X4 on a trip, thought I???d give Bose a try. Result was just disappointing.Here???s a short feedback on the SoundSport. The high freq has poor clarity, weak sound stage, mids is obviously over tuned to mask the lack of details. Bass is over powering and muddy, doesn???t have that focused punch on short bass notes. All over this point to subpar drivers used. Bose is nothing but a name, check their products on audiophile forums, their brand is literally used as a joke to mock other poorly designed over priced audio products.Returned and ordered another Jaybird X4. At least it has decent balance and clarity, and also has much better sound stage than Bose. It also has more refined water resistance and the ability to make custom tuning on their app. Also, Jaybird x4 is so much more comfortable than Bose SoundSport, especially when you wear it over the ear with foam tips.Battery life and BT range is the same between Bose and Jaybird X4."
3	:	"I purchased these in 2016 to use while at one of my clients office due to how loud it gets in there.  When not in use, they're in their case clipped to a ring in my purse.  In other words, they aren't abused in any way.The button that turns them on/off has now broken.  See pics.  $149 may not be a lot of money for some people but I spent the money on these because I knew they'd be comfortable and high quality.....I'm really disappointed that they've started falling apart already...especially since I take such good care of them.  When I can get them turned on, they're awesome."
1	:	"The plastic used on the wire covering is very weak and breaks within a few weeks of normal use. I went through three of these with the same problem before switching to Sony. Bose US stores were switching these out for me but the international stores don???t seem to offer the same service. Besides this issue, I prefer the Bose over the Sony. Oh well. :("
2	:	"This is my second pair of Bose Soundsport headphones. The first pair started having an issue with the left speaker going out right after the warranty expired. I decided that maybe I had given them too much abuse, letting them sit on the floor to charge. So, I bought a second pair about 4 months ago and have babied them, charging only on my desktop and packing away in their case when not using them. Lo and behold, the left ear speaker is starting to crackle and going out on these. I plan on sending these back to Bose, and while I would prefer a refund at this point, I am fairly certain that in the warranty is says they will only repair or replace. So, that's the bad part. Based on this experience, I would not purchase this brand/type again. The unfortunate part is that when they work, they sound great and I love taking phone calls on them because the call clarity is awesome. The person on the other end never hears the melee happening around me when I call."
3	:	"I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. I got two pairs, one of them didn't work properly from day one (sudden static noise that won't go away until you restart the headphones). I returned it and got a replacement, same issue persisted, so I returned the defective pair and purchased a new one from Bose store, the pair worked fine. The other pair that I got from Amazon worked well, however, from early beginning it showed some bugs such as whenever I connect them to my phone, the headphones would claim to be connected to other devices that was previously connected to although non of those devices we're in the range. For example, I would try to connect on the train, the headphones would say that it's now connected to my computer which is at home and then fail to connect right away to my phone. I thought this issue would be solved by one of the firmware updates. It never did. Now, the major problem, however, was the materials from which this headphones is made. I've never seen anything as badly made as this headphones. I purchased mine in February, also bought the battery case, so whenever I am not using them, they're in the case. However, less than four months later, the headphones started showing some serious wear. The plastic buttons started falling apart, the skin surrounding the headphones began to stretch (check the photo) exposing the stuff underneath. Now, the volume button, which aslo popped up out of place, is barely functioning.The quality of the sound is good, but hey, this is Bose, and still the quality is just as good as any other brand in it's category. I've used a couple of Bose products in the past, they we're okay, however, after this experience, I've had it, and I will certainly never buy a Bose ever again.Save your money and get something of higher quality for the same price."
5	:	"I got these for my fianc?? because the mic on his iphone is damaged and he had been coveting my wireless VModa Crossfades.  He needs to be able to multitask and talk for his day job in real estate- but as a DJ he also requires beautiful clear, crisp, balanced sound when casually listening to music. Enter these.He has very fancy wired headphones, but he needed to replace older earbuds. We live in nyc where portability is key, and he's thoroughly impressed by their comfort, compact style and usability. They fit his needs perfectly and he couldn't be more pleased. The bluetooth receiver is strong, he can hear calls clearly and he was surprised by the clarity of sound wirelessly."
5	:	"These babies sound AWESOME. I recently used the Powerbeats2, but after a little over a year, they died on me. Amazon was nice enough to refund me, and I decided (from reading multiple reviews), that the Bose SoundSport were a good choice for me. I am very satisfied that I went with them! Their sound, especially the bass, is by far better than the Powerbeats2. The fit is also really nice, considering I have glasses, so the Powerbeats were a bit annoying. The SoundSport fit nicely in my small ears, and do not shift at all. I will definitely recommend to anyone looking for wireless headphones for every day life or working out!"
1	:	"compared to jaybird..it was more comfortable. But given I live in cold weather I need to put a hat on when I'm out. A lot of time headphone falls off. That why I took one star off.The battery is pretty good. I used three days without charging. (commute about 2 hours every day)After three months usage:I only use 2hours, three four days out of a week. the battery isn't last for a day without charging.Jaybird I've never had this problem...I'm going to contact the company and see what they can do for this product.I will be posting once I receive any response from Bose"
4	:	"I'm impressed.  I bought apple airpods for my wife, and these for me.  Main purpose was for running on both.  The Bose fit surprisingly great.  Once in, they don't fall out.  I've had issues with other bud headhpones fitting right and comfortably.  These are excellent for that.  The sound is excellent, battery time is great, and the stay in place during workouts.  Compared to the airpods, they don't allow any ambient sounds outside, which could be a negative when running outdoors.  I also use them for day to day use at work.  Again, the sound isolation can be a pro or con depending on your perspective.  I can keep them in my ears and shut everything out.  But if someone needs to talk to me, i have to pull one out to hear them.  Airpods are more loose and allow you to keep them in your ear all day while still hearing people speak to you when in your ear.  But my wife did have to get accessories for her airpods for running, like a cord to put around her neck and wing tips to keep them more secure when she runs.  This is something already part of the Bose design.  My only real negative is that these don't look as good when wearing as they stick out quite a bit.  But as far as performance and audio quality, I prefer the Bose over the airpods"
1	:	"Advertised as stay comfortably in the ear during workouts...not so much...start sweating and the cord sticks to your neck and pulls them quickly out of your ears when you turn your head...that's if they even stay that long...any quick jolt and they drop out of your ear.  The unit on the ear is way too big and sticks out so the leverage of that weight with any sudden movement plus sweat and they are not going to stay in...tried all 3 sizes of ear pieces to make sure of the fit and still none will hold them in place.  Comfortable yes, sound is good, easy to use...but if you are active outside of walking then they are a no go.  Initially bought them for my wife, she had no luck keeping them in either...bought a competitors brand she is trying now that seems to fit and secure much better and sound better for less money.  I am trying to get use out of these and it is frustrating with them falling out so easily.  Expected much more from Bose!  Would have returned them but gave them too much trial time and we are past the return time window."
3	:	"Great sound as all Bose products have, but they quit working just over three months in and won't power on at all. Customer support is good (register your product w/ Bose.com and buy cheap Amazon insurance, is I were you...) and I'm getting replacement pair. STILL, that sucks since I've barely put them through anything tough other than some running and typical workouts. They also are used while I bike in the cold but w/ facemask. No reason they should fail like that. Now, I'm stuck w/o good headphones for 2 weeks so that I can return the broken ones and get new ones. I'll update this after more time with the new ones (which come with new warranty at least). Bottom line: Bluetooth earbuds are just hit or miss and aren't the best technology at this point. Maybe in 5 years...for now, unreliable.I've also had occasionally cutting out of Bluetooth connectivity if they are across my body in my left pocket. That's not a long distance as you can imagine. Finally, they are bigger and heavier than you'd think so can fall out under heavy stress w/ sweat combination. All of this is rare and the fit can depend on your ear, but it is an issue on occasion."
5	:	"Sit firmly in the ear without causing pain. A lot of earbuds can make my inner ear ache, maybe it's a moisture thing I don't know...but that doesn't happen with these. Sound quality is great. Use it mostly with my iPhone SE and have no problems, aside from it being a little frustrating to disconnect the bluetooth without turning it off in the settings (but maybe I'm missing something in the very terse manual). I mostly use them for commuting and haven't tried them with intensive exercise yet, but I have no reason to believe there'd be a problem. Has a great range -- didn't disconnect from my phone until I walked across my apartment and up the stairs. Jesus I can't believe it's taken me this long to get bluetooth headphones. So so so so worth it. Glad I was a penny wise and not a dollar foolish this time."
5	:	"I can take the liberty to say that these are at par withBeats Solo 2 headphones but easy to handle and use. Beats Solo2 headphones cannot be really used for workouts as we swear a lot and that sweat stank remain on it. Secondly earphones are better than headphones but very very few earphones give you that satisfaction of pure music with bass. Bose for me will always remain the king in headphones, earphones and speakers. Nothing can match them yet. My five stars to this product. I have actually bought one more for my wife too. Value for money :)"
2	:	"I bought these headphones because I was a big fan of the Bose wired headphones.  These headphones have decent sound quality, but are very bulky and the weight constantly pulls the headphones out of my ear.  Additionally, I have connection problems ALL THE TIME.  All of my other bluetooth headphones connect with no problem; however these never seem to connect.  After turning my phone and the headphones on and off dozens of time, it eventually connects at random.Overall, these are okay, but there are much better options out there for a fraction of the price."
3	:	"The sound is good and typical of what you might expect from Bose. Audiophiles might complain and say that they can get same/better sound quality for lower prices but as a layman, the Bose SoundSport Pulse headphones sound pretty good.One complaint is that there is virtually no noise cancellation. I wasn't expecting any active noise cancellation, but there is almost no passive noise cancellation either. This can be useful for some people, like runners who need to pay attention to their surroundings. But I usually work out at the gym, where it's a bit noisy and I have to crank up the sound a bit.The biggest negative is the heartrate monitor. It's almost worthless. I have an Android phone and tried many apps to find one that could connect to the Bose SoundSport Pulse. None connected reliably. Either they refused to connect at all (I tried many settings), or the connection was very flimsy or had other usability issues. Bose has their own app that can show the heartrate, but the app itself is feature poor with no recording or stats. I later upgraded my phone to an S8 and also didn't have much success. Eventually, I just gave up and use the SoundSport Pulse as a regular headphone.If I had listened to the other reviewers experiencing the same issues, I would have just saved the $50 and gotten the Bose SoundSport. If you want a wireless Bose headphones for $150, go with the regular SoundSport. If you're ok with forking over $300, then I recommend the QC30. I prefer the QC30 for most uses as the added noise cancellation is makes quite a difference in noisy environments."
4	:	"I took off one star, only because they look a little clunky in the ear.  They sound fantastic right out of the box, and are the most comfortable wireless earbuds I have found.  I returned Jaybird X3's because they sounded lousy (even with the sound adjustment app), and they hurt my ears no matter what size end I used.  These are much better, and much less fussy.  These also stay in my ear during my workouts with zero adjustments.  Wish they were made in white with gold or silver accents....these are a little more masculine in look."
5	:	"I love these headphones. I love em so much I bought a second pair and a pair for my brother. I had gone through dozens of the cheaper headphones and couldn't find anything I liked. They either didn't sound good, didn't fit right, or just plain didn't work. But I tried these on at the Bose store and instantly fell in love with them. First, the sound quality is great. Everything sounds so rich and so clear. Second, the fit is just right. The previous headphones I had would always wiggle themselves out of my right ear during a run or while I was lifting. These ones stay right where they are meant to be even during the most vigorous workouts. And lastly, they tell you how much battery power they have left when you turn them on. That may not be a selling point for some people but for me, it helped to know just how much juice I had left before I started my workout. The regret I have is that I didn't spend the money on them sooner."
4	:	"The product itself is fine and the sound quality is great. The bluetooth installation with my phone and laptop worked without any problems. Call me old school, but I felt this wired earphones are better than the new wireless earphones, so I can let it dangle on my neck without worrying about losing it. Also easier to travel in the flights.One thing to note is that - the earphones comes with 3 size fittings. Its really important to make sure you use the one that fits your ear the best. I initially used the default one and that hurt my ears so badly that I almost decided to return it. Once I changed it to the other size that fit my ear, it was very comfortable.Having said that - I still there are quite a few areas that can be improved.a. The volume buttons are pretty hard and needs to be depressed quite a bit. These buttons could have been softer.b. The ON / Off buttons are also very hard to depress. Not sure whats with all the buttons. Can be a little softer so we dont have to press our fingers off?c. Battery life in my opinion needs to be vastly improved. It hardly runs for 3 hours. Does not even last a complete flight.Overall, a good product that can be improved."
2	:	"Sound is great, but bluetooth connection with my iPhone 6 plus is not the best. I've had these for a couple days. Use them when I walk the dog. I listen to pandora, with the SoundSports connected to my iPhone bluetooth, starting pandora from my apple watch. My iPhone is in my pant pocket. I get blanks in music that is annoying as I walk briskly. If I move the phone to my shirt pocket problem resolves.I gave the headphones a 2 because these are designed for activity. Sound quality is good except when it disconnects from music. Great sound poor connectivity."
5	:	"These headphones were on the brink of being returned by me. But after some tweaks to the sound source, these worked like a charm.I had expected these headphones to have good bass with straight out of the factory settings. But the sound does need to be equalized based on your preferences. The bluetooth pairing and battery life are pretty decent and perform as per product description.I use them at the gym and never once felt they would come out during any of my cardio or workout sessions. So far liking them.Do they justify the price I paid.. well that is always subject to the brand value and they do seem a bit overpriced. Given the other choices I had like Jaybird and the other likes, the Bose SS do stand out.Overall a good product."
2	:	"Huge Bose fan and have *many* Bose products including their high end home theater systems.  This is the first negative review i've ever written for Bose product.  I guess if you only wear them for 30 - 60 mins per day for a work out they are OK.  However, voice quality on these headphones is truly a mystery -- sounds like everyone is talking through a sock.  Very muffled audio for phone calls.  I use(d) these a lot for conference call and similar while on travel and they just stink ... period.  So now i use these on the treadmill in the AM and back to using my old Soundsport in-ear wired headphones that are falling apart b/c they sound so so much better for phone calls."
5	:	"The absolute Best Bluetooth headphones I have owned to datePros:??? Very Comfortable??? Very Secure even in extreme movement once you choose the correct buds for your ear??? Spectacular Rich Sound??? Long Battery Life??? Work Well even during Very Sweaty workouts??? Good weight, almost unnoticeable??? Spectacular microphone for making phone calls.Cons:??? Will sometimes unpair for no reason with the IPhone X??? I believe this next problem is due to the most resent apple iPhone update.  but Since that update if my headphones unpair with my iPhone the will no longer aloe me to use the headphones as a headset until I reset my iPhone.  I hope this is fixed by a software update from Apple or Bose"
2	:	Don???t spend your money on this. I expected great things from Bose and they failed on this one. Sound is good but that???s it. This is my second pair (Bose replaced first one) because it won???t charge every time to 100% . At first I thought that???s not a deal breaker but even at 100% it doesn???t last more than 4 or 5 hours. I work outside 8 hrs a day and have to charge it at some point to make sure I can get a call. I don???t even listen to music while I work because it drains faster.If you want it for workouts only then it???s great but if you???re using it as a primary phone Bluetooth forget it.Then they gave you this cheesey little clip that attaches to the cord to clip to your shirt to hold in place . Clip stays on shirt but doesn???t  to the cord . Ugh I???ve lost it several times and this time for good.I???m putting it in a drawer and going back to a $20 Bluetooth that I???ll get more use out of.
5	:	"Best headphones/earbuds purchase I???ve made in a long time. Going wireless is a big advantage for working out at the gym. These also sound fantastic. They are not ???brite??? sounding, rather they are warm and bassy and I like that. The fit is spot on, much like other versions of earbuds from Bose. Charging is made easy with the micro usb cable. Battery life is tough to gauge because these are my first wireless earbuds. Some people complain about the life per charge but what can you realistically expect from such a compact battery?  Tip: you don???t have to plug them into a computer to charge. You can use an Apple wall adapter that comes with iPhones to charge the earbuds. It???s much faster. My only complaint which has nothing to do with the product is the ridiculously over engineered packaging and presentation. Companies know this hooks people into buying their product but I just roll my eyes. The box is oversized and indestructible. There must be $20 worth of box, packaging, graphics, etc. I???d rather see a simple box and a lower retail price. Then Bose saves money and puts the money back into research."
2	:	"These are Bose so let's just say that the actual sound quality is fantastic. They stay in my ears while running and speed walking with zero problems. They are comfortable.  I was in love with them for about a month. Then one day on the way home from a 7.5 mile walk, they died. I had to listen to the birds for the last mile home. I charged them so they would be ready the next morning and  when I took them off of the charger, they were only at 90% charged.  When I returned from an hour of running, they were only at 20%. This continued for weeks. Now when I charge them, they are at 50% and don't even make it for an entire 7.5 miles.  I had to use my alternate earphones twice because these had zero charge after being plugged in overnight. I did a firmware update that I found on Bose website and this did not fix the issue. I am hoping to get an answer from the warranty department soon."
3	:	"I was pretty excited about this headphone set after hearing some positive reviews from friends. However, once I got the phone I found it quite disappointing. For one thing, when you wear the headphones outdoors (i'm definitely wearing it properly and followed the instructions on how to put them on) and there's wind outside, you'll experiencing a wooshing sound created by the wind in the gap of the headphones and your ears. Makes it near impossible to wear them while going for a run.Besides the above which is merely an inconvenience, the headphones seem fairly buggy. They drop connection every once in a while, and sometimes it will say it lost connection, interrupting the music, but it actually is still connected. That's also just an annoyance but it shouldn't be happening with headphones that cost $150.The sound quality is pretty great, as would be expected from Bose. I'm just disappointed by their execution of bluetooth technology."
2	:	"Overall I'd say I'm pretty disappointed. The headphones are just ok- I love cycling and these headphones are fine while sitting at my desk at work, but during active outings like running or cycling the wind greatly affects the sound quality. Sometimes I feel like I can barely hear my music. I kept them for a couple months hoping my overall opinion would change, but it hasn't and I wish I could return them. I've always used Bose products (even my Audi SUV has Bose surround sound) but there aren't worth the money. Also- you can't take calls on these-I'll be selling these and purchasing the Apple AirPods."
5	:	"I have had Bose headgear for years. I bought beats when they were the newest-hottest, but those were over the ear. And a story for another day. Other than that it???s been pretty much Bose for the past 15-20 years. These rank as the BEST buds I???ve ever had, any brand. Maybe the best headgear all around.They provide some of the crispest lows without that overbearing element. The highs are just as clean. When listening to acoustic music I felt as though I was in the room with the musician. One may expect this with the typical wired version, and honestly, I was confident Bose would not disappoint, but they really beat my expectations this time. So that squeeze feeling I had about parting with $200 -that same feeling you probably have - dissipated after the first 5 seconds I pressed play.Drop coin and treat yourself. These will not disappoint. And get the charger case, it takes away the one knock I???d report; the inconvenience of charging limitations."
3	:	"My Bose quiet comfort earphones fell apart before a year was up. When I contacted Bose about them, they were willing to work with me, but they wanted a number on the headphone. Unfortunately, my husband had already taken out the trash where I had dumped them in disgust of the waste of money. Bose wouldn't take the receipt for proof of being bought.Then I bought the cheaper pair after arguing with myself to spend the money and these are already starting to come apart and I miss the quiet blocking ability. I just couldn't afford that much money and what if those came apart again?  So far I can probably repair where this part is falling off, but really? As much as I paid you would think it wouldn't be an issue. I worked as a sound tech for many years and like the sound of bose, but the expense is high and they fall apart. I'll have to go look for a compromise I guess."
2	:	"I had really high hopes for my first Bose product, and this did not deliver. Sure, it sounds good, but so do a lot of earbuds. Don't let the pictures fool you, they are huge and clunky. They are made for sport, but all I can hear while riding my bike at a normal speed is air rushing past them. I don't believe that they claim to have any noise canceling effect, but I can assure you that they have none. Finally, the battery takes a long time to charge, and doesn't stay charged for as long as you would probably like. I noticed this right away, and was not a sign of age.  Often times, even after being left to charge overnight, the battery still doesn't get to 100%. I can't sell them, because who buys used earbuds?! I'm going to continue to use them because they were so expensive and feel like I need to get some kind of return from them. I really just can't wait for them to die so I can throw them away and buy the Jaybirds. I hope this helped you in your decision. This review is completely honest."
2	:	"I am a Bose Fan, and given the chance, I will still buy another headset. However, this headset is poorly made. The sound is good, but the material is bad. Few days after I got it, the first Bose logo came off. I tried to glue it back, but is it not holding. Then few months later the second one came off. Then the battery life start going from 6 hours to 4 hours. The the volume control started peeling off. By the end I am stuck with a piece of junk. Good thing I purchased the protection plan, I do not know what they will do at this point, but I hope they will be able to fix or replace it."
3	:	"I received these in early May and was very happy with them, but after a couple months of average, mostly indoor use I have noticed the rubber surrounding the power button is separating from the plastic. The sound quality remains unchanged (it's excellent), but I have owned Bose products before and I expect high quality craftsmanship from them, so I'm disappointed to see this happen and just hope it doesn't get worse. I really hate to think Amazon sold me a knock off here.UPDATE 12/13/2017: The case kept coming apart to the point where I had to call Bose to check on the warranty. Bose's customer service was excellent and immediately sent me a replacement pair that definitely feels like the quality I would expect from Bose. This new pair feels sturdier, and a little heavier. Even the carrying pouch feels stiffer. I have seen many reviews also showing the casing come apart and it seems Amazon might've received a bad lot, so if you are having this problem, call up Bose if you are still under the warranty period."
5	:	"I have used Bose earbud headphones exclusively for the past 5+ years. I use the Soundsport and the noise cancelling headphones. This is my first pair of wireless and they work great.  Similar sound to the Soundsport headphones.  These bleed more sound than my noise cancelling headphones, but still less than an on ear pair of headphones like Beats. The size profile takes a minute to get used to, but surprisingly, these stay put when I am doing HIIT workouts and jogging and they are substantial enough to feel balanced in the ear. The cord  gets stuck to the back of my neck occasionally when sweaty but otherwise is unnoticeable. I love the convenience of being able to reach up to the cord at my right ear to skip a track or adjust the volume.  Easy to sync and intuitive placement of the buttons (if you are right-handed).  I have worn these 5-6 days a week for the past month without problem."
4	:	"I have all the same issues of the earbud/controls plastic and rubber separating and got mine in Nov of 2017. I first noticed it starting about 2 months ago but to be honest, I keep them on me all the time and not in the pocket case since it takes up to much space in my pocket. As such, I personally can't point the finger at Bose for my particular issues. I'm sure the pull apart for me is from the rubber being very good and ""grabby""so when I take them in and out of my pocket over and over all day they just stretched and separated over time. This is not to say that they have failed in any way either since the performance is still great and I am very happy with them. I didn't realize there is a warranty so I think I will email Bose what has happened due to my usage specifics and see if they have a fix or if they are actually designed to handle such use and I just happened to get a pair that had a couple issues."
4	:	"I've been using wired Sennheiser earbuds for years that rock.  Decided to change out for these for my workouts.  I like them, but don't love them.  So here's the pros:1. They really are comfortable.  The size and weight people pooh pooh on aren't really noticeable.2. Sound quality is really good.  They don't approach my Sennheiser's but I didn't expect them to.  That being said, the bass reproduction which I'm a stickler on was crisp and sounded good at lower levels although at higher listening levels, it was weak IMO.3. The HR monitor is awesome.  I've been using a BT Polar HR monitor for years.  This one is dead on accurate to that for my workouts.  Better than my iWatch.  So I use the HR monitor in these headphones for monitoring real workouts and my iWatch for everything else.Now for the cons:1. All the reviews about noise due to fit are dead on.  They don't fit fully into the ear canal so you do get background noise.  Decide whether that's important.  My Sennheiser's do which is on the reasons the bass is so good.2. They're not loud enough.  Because they don't fit fully into my ear and with ambient noise, I find I have to listen with the volume at max.  Whereas the in-ear headphones - I've never needed to get above 1/2.Overall - I'm pleased with my purchase.  I wanted headphones that let in ambient sounds when I bike ride.  I wanted really good sound fidelity.  These do it.  I wanted the simplicity of an integrated and accurate HR monitor.  Check.  The only gripe I have - I just wished they would get a bit louder, but that's probably not a bad thing for my ears as I age."
2	:	"Very nice sound and feel, clean simple light and well balanced feel and sound, I've been using the Samsung level pro which I like the battery life but sound was not what I needed so I tried the BOSE and what a difference in base and clarity but not the battery life but I'm willing to give up some battery life for a much better sound quality.I had originally given this a 5 star rating but due the the control buttons falling apart and having BOSE tell me that they'll do me a favor to exchange it although it's under 1 year old. Thanks BOSE."
3	:	"I adore my Bose Soundwave. I thought these would be a logical choice. They are well built and have decent battery life. However, I literally had to crank these up to 90%+ volume when I went outside, that was on a non-windy day. As soon as I started moving, the sound of wind was all I could hear. They have the Bose sound quality, when it's quiet. All of my other headphones I can hear really well at 30%-40%, I rarely have to crank them past 50% volume.These had potential, the sound quality is there, if you can hear it."
1	:	"I would love to rate these 5 stars but these will not stay in my ears with any of the 3 different sizes of earbuds included. If I were to run they would easily fall out of my ears within a few seconds. I am extremely disappointed a company like Bose couldn't do better research and provide earbuds that actually fit different peoples ears. Obviously, the S/M/L system doesn't work for everyone. It really sucks to pay for these and import into my country to find out they won't even work. A complete waste of money I can't even begin to say how disappointed I am in this purchase. Normally I am a Bose fan and have several Bose products. These are a complete FAIL."
5	:	"Pros: Long battery life, awesome sound, seamless Bluetooth connecting with excellent rangeCons: Initial setup required some troubleshooting to get the volume right, see my review for the solutionThese wireless headphones have exceeded my expectations.  I use these in an ""open"" office, so half cubicle walls, with everyone's voice being audible from across the room.  Working in IT, I need an isolated feel to focus on my work, these headphones do that job very well.  I had some initial trouble with the volume, as have several others who have purchased them recently, but there's an easy fix for it.  The Bose has an independant volume control from your phone that you wouldn't expect.  So upon initial connecting, the volume will sound very low, just use the manual volume up buttons on the wire itself and raise the volume.  Suddenly you have the best sounding wireless headphones on the market, with good passive noise cancellation.  Even unpowered they muffle surrounding noise sources enough that I can't make out speech.  Battery life runs about 4.5 - 5 hours, with about a 1 hour charge, time, not bad at all.  The headset is also excellent for calls, and connects seamlessly to both my laptop, and my phone.  As stated initially I use these for office use primarily, however I also take occasional walks while wearing to stretch my legs.  They stay firmly placed in your ear, and I can definitely see these working for running.  Overall I'd highly recommend these, they sound excellent, are very comfortable and stay in place.  I can wear them for 3 hours straight without any comfort issues."
4	:	"The quality of sound is outstanding. All frequencies of sound come through. Highs and lows both well represented.And since it fits in the outer ear, but the middle, it???s quite comfortable. How comfortable is comfortable?  You???ll forget that you???re wearing them.The only draw is the poorly glued rubber surroundibgboiece that contains both the power/ menu button and the protective door over the exposed interior of the power port.Over time, the rubber separates making it tricky to turn the device on. How long does this take to occur. I use the headphones 6-10 hours a day and usually under a year.  But for this price and this quality of actual earphone speaker, I???d expect better quality of cheap glue and rubber vs plastic outer protection.When Bise addresses this deficiency, this will be a legitimate ?????????????????????????????? (5 star) product."
1	:	"After 16mos of owning this product, I am updating my review. The sound quality played through the earbuds is great. My bad review of the product is due to the quality of the parts. My original review commented on how the collar clip frequently broke. Bose was kind enough to send me several of these, so for now I am good. the clips typically break after about 3-4mos of use.The mic quality when on a phone call has increasingly gotten bad. It is at the point now where unless I am in a closed room with no other noise, the person on the other end of the call can not hear me.The attached pics reflect the rubber housing for the earbuds. both the Right and Left bud housings are loose. I am not sure why this happened, because it wasn't always like this. I use the buds most every day, for at least 60-90 min (during my workout), so I am not sure if this is the result of daily use, or if there was some kind of connecting adhesive that lost its function. Whatever the reason, this results in a tricky game when trying to power on the buds (the button has to be perfectly aligned with the internal switch).Unfortunately for me, my 1yr warranty expired 4mos ago. However, perhaps this review will save someone else the frustration of having their $150 pair of earbuds fall apart. Either pay close attention to the quality around the 10-12mo mark or go with a pair that has a longer life expectancy."
5	:	"These are fantastic.  I wear them frequently.  As advertised,  they have been sweat resistant and the sound is fantastic.  It keeps its charge for a few hours and stayed snug in my ears no matter how much I moved around.  My only caveat is that they look silly and draw attention by protruding from your ears.  Not sure if they need to be that bulky in order to work as well as they do, but I for one do not like drawing that much attention to such a pilferable item."
2	:	"Sound quality is ok but construction is not what I would expect. I???ve had these about 8 months and they have fallen apart. First, the clothing clip broke off but that wasn???t too big a deal. The play/pause button never worked right. I???d hit pause and it wouldn???t, hit play and it wouldn???t, it was annoying. I???d have to hit it pretty hard for it to catch until finally about 2 months ago it just stopped working altogether. Now the on/off switch isn???t working either. Definitely not worth it, find something else."
5	:	"I feel unfair giving it anything less than 5 stars because it is an awesome product and produces amazing sound. However, personal preference gives way here. My Beats in ear sport headphones broke and I purchased a protection plan from Amazon. Come to find out, Amazon no longer sold beats headphones (that I wanted) so I got these instead. Sound is clear and loud. Personally, I am a fan of heavier bass than treble. These Bose headphones do pack a powerful bass, but I never heard a quality bass like those in the Beats. I am keeping these Bose headphones and have no issues with them while out and about. When I get home though, I put my wired beats on. (don't even have to actually wear them, you can hang them around your neck and the sound can be heard rooms over)."
4	:	"I was skeptical that these would stay in my ears given that they are larger (and I am a petite woman). However, they sit very comfortably, and stay in place during my full run without me needing to fiddle with them. The sound quality is wonderful, and makes it more enjoyable to run and listen to music without having to crank the volume to try and hear the full sound picture. They are not noise cancelling, but I wanted that for running so I can hear cars/bikers/pedestrians coming up behind me. I would recommend these to anyone - deducted one star because the battery life is not as long as some other bluetooth headphones I have (around 6 hours on average), but they charge fairly quickly so it's not a problem."
4	:	"The headphones were easy to connect to the galaxy phone i have. The bose software easily recognized the headphones and connected. I won't make it too technical as im not an avid audiophile. The comfort is very nice and adjustable since it comes with the different size earbuds. I have run up to 8miles with the headphones on and they did not shift or become uncomfortable. The battery power has not completely depleted during any of my runs. I have used it 4 times a week for about an hour each time and it worked great each time.  The controls are pretty easy to use and strategically located on the cord for easy reach. It's a great sports headphone for the intermediate workout enthusiast. The sound quality is great, the base and mid-tones allow for the wide range of sound to be enjoyed during your workout and the design , while not noise cancelling, produce a nice seal to keep out noise."
5	:	"I bought these headphones on Black Friday and they worked amazingly out of the box HOWEVER:. the charging was trash. It got to the point where I'd charge these puppies for 2 days at a time and they'd only get to between 50% to 60% charged (according to the headphone prompt). They'd actually never charge to 100%.  After a few months of sucking it up, it got too much to put up with since I paid good money for these.  I contacted Bose directly and a spoke to an assistant through their website in a chat.  In 20 minutes, she had everything ready to initiate a warranty exchange.  I thought they'd just repair or replace the battery. Bose actually sent me a new package of the exact headphones. Aside from the amazing acoustic performance of these headphones, Bose provided amazing customer support.  I will definitely be a returning customer!"
3	:	"I wanted to like these since they had good reviews, and I love the Bose IE2 headphones I've been using for 5 years.I got these to go with my Pixel 2, which has no headphone jack.Complaints:* The fit somehow amplifies some sounds when music is off, e.g. I can feel a pressure difference with every step I take, and I hear myself breathing in a weird way* They take forever to connect to my phone sometimes. One day it's fast, another day I power cycle them 3x and wait ~10s each time with no music* They stick out too far, and the pressure change is disconcerting if you touch them. Bumping them on something would be unpleasant"
2	:	"I so much wanted to like these. The soundsport wired ones were absolutely amazing but these are terrible, especially considering the price. First is the weight of the in-ear part. The extra part which sticks out doesn't bother me as much as I expected but it takes almost no pressure to knock them out of your ear. Until that happens they feel like they're falling out the whole time.Second is the connecting wire. This torture device has no friction and doesn't stay on your neck at all. They give you one of those clips but it doesn't work well with collars, comes off if you turn your head to quick, and broke the other day while I was pulling it out of my pocket. Replaced it with one of those reverse bending hair clips and it made a world of difference. Without this the weight of the loose wire was enough to pull the ear pieces out.Overall a terrible experience. If my beats still worked I would switch but alas that's not an option."
2	:	"The good: light, comfortable, sound quality was great, and Bose has fantastic customer service.The bad: 1) After a few months of normal use, the buttons on the wire starting coming apart.  Bose replaced them with a new pair.  2) The microphone is way too sensitive and picks up EVERYTHING.  If we were talking on the phone and my TV was on (at a reasonable volume) you could hear me, but I would be drowned out by the TV noise.  One person I talked to asked if I was at a parade...I was walking through a department store with normal foot traffic.  I returned the Bose and picked up the Apple Air Pods, which I'm much happier with.Short story: If you're looking for a wireless headset for workouts/runs, get the SoundSports.  If you'll be making phone calls with any regularity, look elsewhere."
5	:	"I had originally tried a pair of these that my girlfriend had. She had the small set of rubber plugs on her pair. I did not like the sound or the bass. Both were unimpressive. I then got mine in the mail. I put the large fittings on and the sound and the bass were completely different. Much much much better. As with all those products Bose offer, a solid bass and wonderful highs and mids."
5	:	"Hands down these are still the best earbuds I've found.The ear bud is BY FAR the most comfortable I've ever found, and they stay put! The silicone is super soft and the sound quality is great.  I also own the wired version and have bought multiple as gifts for people, all who have been very happy with them.I do prefer the wired version's silicone tips vs these.  These have a double wall style that are more noise canceling, but the great thing is the standard silicone tips fit these so I just bought a 2 pack and swapped them out."
5	:	"Bought these beauties in Citron (Cyber Monday for $99, now $129 thru 12.30.17 and then back up to $149) and so glad I did!  I am a jogger and live in Phoenix, AZ so not much humidity but I do sweat and these are truly sweat proof  The last 3 pair of headphones were Plantronics BackBeat Fit  and while they louder and have more bass I didn't notice how heavy they were until I got the Bose.  The Plantronics are great at $89 but these are a splurge at $149  The Bose SoundSport are very clear and have more accuracy but not as loud.  They will not fall out of your ears and I have very small ears.  They come with 3 sizes of earpieces S, M & L.  I am using the Small. If the price is stopping you I highly recommend the Plantronics they are the best kept secret for $80 everyday and they are fantastic.  Hope this review helps with your decision.https://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-BackBeat-Fit-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B01I0VIMK0/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1511917856&sr=8-4&keywords=plantronics+backbeat"
1	:	"I called Bose support when the power button on my Soundsport head phones stopped working after 6 months. I took really good care of these ear buds. When they were not in use or charging, they were in the case.The support guy (obviously not in the US) said all would be taken care of. When I did not receive my mailer I sent an email to Bose support. The response I got was that they had no record of my call. The call took an hour. Beware of Bose and their new international support."
5	:	"I had Beats exercise bluetooth headphones thinking they would be good quality.  While the return and repair process worked well, in my mind it shouldn't be a process that needs to be used to begin with.  After the third breakage, I decided to buy what my daughter and wife are using.  They have had theirs for 2 years, no problems.  Sound quality is better with actual bass notes and they stay in my ear when running.  I've had Bose QC2 headphones for years and am a believer in Bose quality."
1	:	"Great sound and fit, wish I could turn the volume up a little more but otherwise the best ear buds I've ever had.  Update: they quit working one day for no reason even with a full charge.Talked to Bose CS and they are shipping me out an expedited replacement set.  Hopefully they last longer than five months this time.Update 2: I've come to the conclusion these are not as sweat proof as I was lead to believe.  Started getting static and a high pitched noise in the left bud while working out, even when they're turned off.  Contacted Bose CS again but haven't received a response yet so I wouldn't recommend these for working out, especially for the price."
1	:	"These are absolutely the WORST headphones to buy! I originally bout some and had multiple issues within 2 weeks so I contacted customer service and they replaced them. The headphones I currently have the same issues and more! I charge them at night, and when I get olup kn the morning they are at 100%. By the time I get to the train to go to work in downtown Chicago, they are at 30% and they are not even turned on!!! I have had to purchase other headphones for working out and for work. The sound quality is AMAZING during the first use and they continuously go down hill from there. As stated before. The battery does not hold a consistent charge, and they randomly fall out my ears, even though there are adaptors. This has been my WORST buy and I am not happy whatsoever."
2	:	"I really wanted to like these headphones. I have ALWAYS chosen Bose for all my audio products. I love my old Freestyle buds but these wireless headphones are a huge disappointment. 1. The battery is terrible! They die after four hours? They take a long time to charge too. 2. The soundpulse is faulty. If you are doing cardio, forget it. Even if your right earbud slightly fell out you will hear ???adjust left earbud??? or something like that. They do not stay in your ears while moving so you constantly have to fix them and it loses your heart rate. 3. THE WORST PROBLEM IS THE VOLUME. I have NEVER had a worse experience with low volune than with these headphones. I decided to write this review now after months of saying I would because I am at a coffeeshop trying to hear a lecture on my computer (these are Barbri special videos in which there is no background noise and the speaker is wearing a mike; normally loud enough through my computer speakers) and I CANNOT HEAR because the coffeeshop has background music. However, even yesterday when I was in a silent room I was having trouble hearing the lecture through my headphones and my MacBook Pro???s speakers were more audible. This is so unacceptable."
5	:	"These headphones are top-notch. I highly recommend that you purchase these. Don't worry about those Jaybirds.I bought the Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones about 3 months ago, and I have thus far had no issues with it. I use these headphones every single day for about 3-4 hours, as I use them for working out as well as entertainment video watching. The headphones are indeed water-resistant; I sweat like a waterfall during the two hour sessions in the gym. The build is rugged, and the cord is nice and thick. Based off of my experience, the battery lasts about 6 hours on a full charge.As to my knowledge, the Bose SoundSport Wireless headphones are the best headphones in the market - the only reported downside being the fact that it is somewhat bulky. I retort that argument with the question: why does one even care? These headphones are the best in the market, and no one in the gym is going to care that the headphones are large; in fact, I perceive many people sporting the exact same headphones all around.These headphones ARE NOT for any activity that may cause excessive wind (biking downhill, downhill skating, etc.). The wind will prevail over the audio dispersing from the headphones. However, if conditions are safe, one can turn their head to either side and the music can then be heard.All in all, purchasing these headphones is a no-brainer. There is top quality, build, and sound. What else could one ask for?Best,Jerry.I will update this review during the coming few months."
5	:	"This is my second purchase of these headphones.  Unfortunately, after a year of great service, I left my headphones in my gym shorts while doing laundry and they never worked again.  But I love the quality and sound of them so much that I bought another pair.  I've previously purchased the PowerBeats and there's absolutely no comparison in sound to these Bose SoundSports.  The PowerBeats just sounded OK, nothing great. The PowerBeats definitely have a better battery life though.  The sound of the Bose SoundSports is amazing with great bass and great highs.  I love the headphones for the gym.  They're very comfortable and stay in my ears without any problem even while I'm running.  The only issue I had with my second pair is that Amazon shipped a set that was obviously used (when I turned them on,  they were trying to connect to a phone I didn't have and they weren't even packaged properly).  But Amazon sent out a new pair and all is well.  I'd definitely recommend these headphones for the gym and working out.  They're also nice for work, although the battery life really isn't sufficient for a full day."
1	:	"I've had the headphones for about 4 weeks and they died on me today...I charged the headphones at 100% before my run. They worked for about 20' before stopping. It's been impossible to restart them ever since. I tried pretty much everything I found on the Bose customer website but it didn't work out.I'm glad I bought them through Amazon as a replacement pair is on its ways so 5 stars to Amazon but none to Bose for the quality of their product. Looking at the Bose Customer community forum, it seems that I'm not the only one with this problem :("
4	:	"To those who don't think this is not the bose sound, I would say, at beginning, it wasn't even 10% of the bose sound quality I expected, I almost returned it but heisted. as many may know, audio products needs some time running before it can get into the good state, headphones usually takes total 96 hours to start perform better, it is a tough job for a battery operated one, so it took me almost a month listening to the bad sound now and then before I started to realize it is producing the bose sound eventuallyWhile it is still not the best-bose-sound,  I'd agree it worthies $100+ probably, and giving the rest of $50 to the bose name,I wished at the beginning to give the rest $50 to the umbrella design but it didn't work for me, it puts a lot of pressure in the ear tunnel so that it feels bad if I wear it for long, so 4 starts"
3	:	"These are fine. I struggle with headphones in this style because I have very small ears.  Jaybirds were a fail for me so I used a pair of cheapo TaoTronics wireless headphones with the over hear hooks which worked really well.  I wanted better quality headphones so I went with these.  The smallest ear tips work ok, but they don't feel super secure.  They work fine for my purposes but I wish they fit better.  Also, the sound is great but it's not loud at all.  Unsure if this is a safety feature or what, but it is loud at the gym and these headphones don't block out the noise.  I'm keeping them, but my cheap TaoTronics are better.  Oh well."
5	:	"after buying a few cheap earbuds for the gym on amazon and having them break pretty quickly I decided to spend the money and get these. They are incredible. They charge fast, sound perfect, connect instantly and have given me no issues. My brothers PowerBeats2 on the other hand give him nothing but issues every time he tries to use them, takes him a few minutes just to get the to connect.Bose is worth the $$$"
5	:	"AWESOME! Just opened the box hit one button nice voice said 50% charged connected to my phone and was testing the sound with the who ""imminent front"" and WOW. sound was better than concert and clean, perfect bass.... tried jayz 99prob... better than i could have imagined.. wort every dollar..  Cant wait to wear them training hard at the gym tomr..I tried many before and tested many in stores but these to me atlest kicked my ass. love these.. also the quality, packaging etc like your getting a Roll Royce. Bose nailed it!  I would buy more if i had more heads haha"
5	:	"Yes, they are bigger than other bluetooth earbuds, but once you put these in your ears you won't care if they had rainbow disco balls on the ends. The sound is INCREDIBLE, and that's likely due to their size.PROS:- THE SOUND- Comfortable- Lightweight- Sturdy mic/remote- Pairs quickly- Has an on/off/pair button (can't tell you how the lack of such a button frustrated me with my last bluetooth headphones)CONS:- A little bulky for earbuds- Can't use them all day without charging (battery lasts most of a work day)The cons are so minor as to be negligible though. Did I mention they sound amazing?"
2	:	"I bought the pixel buds for my Pixel 2 and had to return them because they were crap. I bought these as a replacement and was mostly happy they were a huge improvement over the pixel buds. Sound quality for music is very good, sound quality for phone calls is not consistent. They are best for making phone calls in a nice quiet space when you don't have to move alot. I've had listeners on the other side complain that there's lots of noise when i'm just walking around.The reason i'm giving these a crappy review of 2 starts is because the battery life declined SHARPLY after 7 months of use. It's gotten to the point that after I fully charge them, they are at 30 percent within 30mns sometimes without use.Also the little clip that these come with is really fragile and broke in my pocket.I love the Bose company, I really hope there's a fix for this."
5	:	"Let me start by saying I have small ears. Not like abnormally small but the apple earbuds don't fit in my ears, they just fall out small. I purchased The Beats sport earbuds and these to see which I liked better. The Bose were superior in every way that mattered to me. First, the sound was superior, the Bose have a rich full sound and the Beats were hollow. Second, the fit.  The Beats had a seam on the earbud that was very irritating to my ear, the over ear part was also too large. The Bose fit very comfortably and stay put no matter how much I am sweating. The battery lasts forever as long as you remember to turn them off again when you're done. These are the best headphones I've ever had by far."
1	:	"I have bought four soundsport headsets one with the heart rate monitor and three without.  The first pair was the heart rate monitor, it lasted a little over a year and then would not take a charge.  No warranty after a year.  Went to the regular pair and it lasted about six months, would not charge.  Got a pair under warranty, lasted about 15 months.  Last pair, about 15 months.  I workout about 2-3 times a week inside, on a treadmill.  Went into a Bose shop, gotta do all that warranty stuff on line, can???t get them wet (do I wear them in the shower?), make sure you have a high quality charger (if you don???t supply the charger, better design a product that can handle what is out there).  Yes, the sound quality is great, yes they are compact.  Hard to sync to an apple device sometime.  I have Bose sound systems, blue tooth speakers, computer sound systems, all work great and last a long time.  Not the headsets.  Done buying Bose headset products."
5	:	"These headphones have served me well for well over a year now, and when I found them in my dryer with the laundry, I was worried they wouldn't make it. But to my surprise, they actually worked after charging. Although they did have some slight glitches, specifically with the button on top, which had become very loose while in the wash, they still sounded about the same.Now when I found them in the dryer a second time, I again was worried. No way they would survive both times. But alas, they actually work better somehow. The previous issue I had with the button on top (randomly telling me the battery life, or disconnecting/reconnecting the Bluetooth randomly) has completely gone away.The battery life seems to be about the same as it was previously, maybe slightly less, but they still last for a good bit of time. Needless to say, I would highly recommend these headphones. Perfect for everyday listening, cancel outside noise fairly well.Side note, always check your sweatshirt pockets."
1	:	"This is the second pair of these earphones I have owned, which I bought to replace a lost pair.  I wear them to run and workout.  The sound is/was great, but the durability is terrible.  I have had this pair for just under 10 months and the left earphone stopped working about 2 weeks ago, leaving sound only from the right side.  The problem seems to be in the wiring, since occasionally sound ""flickers"" from the left side.  I sweat a lot when I run, but I thought Bose had taken care of this issue a year ago.  I do not want to spend $150 every 10 months on earphones, so I will start looking for a more durable product.  Sorry, Bose."
5	:	"I love these.I burned out two other sets of headphones with my workout sweat. These have held up well in the couple weeks since I received them. The sound quality is really good. I'm no audiofile, but I appreciate good sound and cannot tolerate inferior sound quality. These are a pleasure to listen to. Clear quality of both treble and bass sounds. The controls are a very basic simple design that is easy to learn.My only con is that even with the smallest earplugs attached, these are still a little big for my little ears and therefore slightly uncomfortable for long periods of time. But they have never fallen out of my ears. Not on the treadmill. Not during circuit training. Not during an active yoga practice. Not during a run on the beach.I wear these for multiple hours sometimes, and the battery life has been good. I've never gotten below 60 percent battery. They also have an auto-shut off feature that kicks in when you haven't actively used them for a while, further preserving battery for when you actually need it.These were expensive, but one of the favorite things I've purchased in quite some time."
5	:	These are great!!  The middle size ear things fit just right in my ears.  They rest there in the front part of my ears and just blow that Bose speaker sound into my head! I have no problem working out with them on.  I have never had them slip.  First I had the over ear blue tooth bose but they weren't right for the beach and didn't fit well on the plane with a cap on (bald head).  The buds solved all of that.  People tell me the microphone sounds good on calls and they control my old ipod nano and my android phone. Not noise cancelling but the ear thing and the bose speaker sound makes them seem like it.  Easy to pair with voice prompts. That little clip on the back helps too.
5	:	"I have always had major problems with in ear headphones actually staying in my ear when I move around... forget them staying in when I run.  These are awesome!!!  I don't really use the heart rate monitor that is built into them (my watch handles that) and it's a good thing because it seems to be unable to detect my hear rate quite often.. I dunno.. maybe I'm dying repeatedly while I run.. kinda feels like it sometimes.  However, if I am dying I'm doing so while enjoying the superb sound quality that you expect from something with the Bose name on it."
5	:	"The best feature of Bose in-ear headphones continue to be the (StayHear) tips. They're by far the most comfortable on the market and lock headphones into your ears for an amazing fit. I personally can't stand regular earbuds that are just inserted into your ear canal.Very easy Bluetooth pairing and they sound great. The medium buds were the best fit for me. I can see where sweat can loosen the fit if you sweat a lot, but the silicone ear locks do a great job of keeping these buds in your head. The neck band / cord is shorter than a lot of neck buds, but I'd rather have less cord hanging than not. Plus, these buds look reasonably sporty and not tacky.Overall very satisfied with the product. Small complaint is microphone tech still isn't the best for price. Wish it came with a charging case for added convenience - it does come with a cloth case."
5	:	"Easily the best sounding of all similar sets I've tried. Pairs effortlessly with my Samsung Galaxy 8, iPhone and Macbook all at the same time. A single button click on the right bud swaps between devices. These things sound great and ""just work"" without the apps Bose offers to connect etc.After 11 months of heavy use they began to lose battery life and generally fall apart. I called Bose support and was told they were out of the 1 year warranty. I quickly insisted I had a receipt proving otherwise and support emailed me a prepaid shipping label. I printed it, stuck it to a box and dropped the old phones in. 6 days later a new, updated pair showed up with a new 1 year warranty.Totally worth it, great support and the best device of its kind I've found."
5	:	"Purchased the product and I have now had it for almost 2 years.The sound quality is still superior, I use it when doing gym activities as well as when working spending a good 4-6 hours a day using them.Pros: The material quality is amazing and has not shown any deterioration as of yet; However the clip that comes with the product did break fairly quickly.Cons: The battery has shown slight loss of performance, with giving me a mere 4 hours of use now instead of the original 6 I am used to get. The charging will sometimes show fully charged even tho its only been on charge for 5 minutes."
1	:	"I purchased a ""New"" pair of soundsport headphones. When I received my package, it was clear that these were not brand new. They had already been paired to someone elses pixel 2 phone, and the box had clearly been opened before.The soundsport headphones are great. This would have been my second pair and the first lasted at least 3 years. The only reason I purchased a ""new"" pair was because I lost the first.I will be returning this pair and I would like a NEW pair of headphones..."
4	:	So far these seem to have a very good battery life after reaching full charge. I like the volume controls built into the cord. It also comes with 3 different ear piece adapters should you have rather large or small ear canals making it work for anyone. The only thing I don't like is that I've had other brands that are 40% cheaper but have similar sound quality. Bose has always been overpriced but I went ahead and got them hoping their overall quality and craftsmanship will keep them working longer than the cheaper brands. Sound quality difference is zero in my opinion.
5	:	"Have never purchased a Bose product I have not liked.  The quality is there, the look is nice and they work.  Maybe it is the fit but these are the best!  Plus I like to have some control through the app.  The only thing I would like to see improved is the flap that goes over the charging port can be a little difficult to open and I always feel like I am going to rip it off - even though I never have."
5	:	"These headphones from Bose are comfortable and stay in my ear unlike many others, but also the trick is to wash your ears and dry them before you put them in, it's also good for your hygiene! However, battery lasts like few hours. I got replacement for the first one as it kept loosing connection with the phone. They look kind of bulky but who cares if they function mostly well and are comfortable."
1	:	"Not a great product from Bose. I purchased 6 months ago and the headphones are already falling apart. As you can see by my picture the rubber on the volume control is falling out and the rubber around the headphone and power button is falling off. Those are just the visible issues. The headphones also do not hold a charge for 6 hours of music playing  as marketed. They last one or two hours before telling me to plug them in. When I do they charge for 5 min and say they are fully charged, just to repeat the cycle. As far as performance goes the sound quality is good but they are not very loud. When not in use I always kept the headphones in their case in my backpack. I wasn???t  looking for the loudest headphones, just a pair that lasts and that I can hear over my footsteps and breathing while running. Regrettably Overall this produxt failed to deliver. Not worth the price. I???ll use these until I can???t any more, then it???s time to find a new product."
5	:	"After agonizing over which of these to buy for my boyfriend, I settled on Bose, which is a brand we know and trust. Well worth the money so far. Clear sound, great volume for his workouts or just to put them in to ignore me around the house lol. Loud but I can't really hear them sitting close. My bf is a runner and hasn't taken them for a full spin yet. Very happy so far. Can't wait to get the charging case (when I recuperate from the $$$ of these headphones). Great instructions. He has an iPhone (8 or something...I'm not an Apple person) and it took 5 min to sync. Highly recommenfed."
3	:	"The design of the packaging was simple yet refined.  One way to describe it is like unboxing an Apple product.  It seems modern and sleek and just a pleasure to unwrap to see what treasure lies beneath.  The packaging wasn???t cumbersome; you did not have to untie a million plastic/metal ties or separate plastic to unleash the awaiting prize.  The package included the ear phones, a set of small and large ear tips to go with the medium ones already on the device along with a carrying case.At first glance these Bluetooth wireless buds looked to be bulky to include the in-line mic/volume device and heavy like a pair of cheap knockoffs I had previously ordered off of Amazon.  One note on the knockoff QY7???s is that the sound quality and battery life were really not that bad, especially for  the very little money that they were purchased for.  The QY7???s felt bulky, heavy and made my ears hurt and feel tired after about 30 min.I picked them up and surprisingly they felt very light albeit still bulky comparted to the Jaybird Bluebuds that I have and use as well.  I left the original size medium ear tips on and placed them into my ears.  They are the MOST COMFORTABLE ear buds that I have ever worn.  I have used these for 2 months now.  I work out 6-7 days a week doing Crossfit and training for marathons.  So, I can say that I have spent many hours a week with these in my ears and they have never given me that hurting or ???heavy??? feeling all the other Bluetooth earbuds have in the past.  On caveat that is a drawback for me is that when I work out especially in the winter; I wear a microfiber beanie hat.  With these in my ears the bulkiness of them becomes a drawback leading to uncomfortableness from size if these pushing on my inner ear from the beanie.  I have the Jaybirds that have a smaller form factor and do not do this when I wear the beanie.  I also want to note that these NEVER fall out of my ears and I NEVER have to readjust them during exercise which is a HUGE plus for me.  Just a side note; the apple earbuds DO NOT stay in my ears at all!!  I have to mess with them the whole time when exercising, in fact, if they are the only ones in my gym bag I go WITHOUT!!The material seems to be hard plastic and soft rubbery plastic that overall feels top end and has given me no issues thus far.  I sweat profusely and have had no issues with sweat altering the performance of these headphones.  The added clip to attach them to your shirt seems to work as intended but for me most of the time it pulls from the wire and stays on my shirt if I do not get a good grip on the actual clip.The in-line mic and volume button has worked flawlessly for me to this point.  The negative for is that it is extremely bulky as if there were a separate battery stored in there or something.  I find that because of its size and heaviness it swings back and forth when I run and it can get super annoying on long runs.  I don???t really notice it when doing Crossfit or lifting.  The structure has held up fine with no malfunctioning parts or rips or tears as of yet.  The reported sound quality of the mic from people that I have called has seemed to be good even when I am running or in the car with windows down.Connecting these headphones to my devices was easy and painless.  You can be connected to 2 devices at one time which is pretty cool.  The other plus for me is that the range is outstanding.  When in the gym this is awesome thing.  It makes it so I don???t have to take my phone around the gym with me.  I have a gym with a track around it and I can go do a lap and come back and never lose a connection.  I bet it is over a 100ft away at the far end of the track.The battery life is probably on the low end of average.  You would think with the size of the earbuds and in-line mice with volume controls it would be at least 8 hours if not 10.  I can almost get 4 days out of one charge, if I don???t watch Netflix or anything like that at night.  One feature on the battery is that when you turn them on they have a voice that tells you how much battery life you have remaining and it is always rounded to the nearest 10%.  So, if you actually had 96% battery life it would say; you have 90% battery life remaining.  To some it may not be annoying but for me I want to know exactly.Sound quality is as to be expected by Bose.  It is very clear and even feeling.  The highs are not too high and mids are perfectly balanced and the base is not super bassy (is that even a word???).  I think that someone that likes a lot of bass might be disappointed but for me it is perfect.  A couple things to note is that these are not noise cancelling and are not marketed to be.  These seem to have the perfect balance of passive noise meaning that when I???m running I am totally immersed into the music but when a car comes near I can still hear it.  Which I find amazing!!"
4	:	"Love these headphones and basically you never go wrong with Bose products (at least in my experience with their products) but the only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the battery life on here only last about 6-8 hours and the bulky earbuds and the useless clip it comes with. Comparing it to other brands of earbuds, you can usually let it go without charging it for a few days. Other than that, the sound is far better than any other set of wireless earbuds I have had and if you can put up with the short(er) battery life and bulky ear buds then these are hands down awesome!"
5	:	"These have become an essential part of my day. I use them constantly for calls at work, for listening to music on my Mac, and for listening to audiobooks on my phone when I'm walking or at the gym. The handoff between devices is nearly seamless, and it just seems to know the priority -- calls from my phone are more important than tunes from the computer. The charge lasts a long time, although I am somewhat strategic about when I charge them at my desk during the day."
5	:	"Extremely comfortable (basketball, running) and excellent sound quality.  Battery is about 5-6 hours of usage which is fine for what I needed.  Upgraded/updated from PowerBeats2 and it's a night and day difference.  My Beats had trouble staying connected (Android) and I was never crazy about the sound or how they sat in my ears.  Bose is better in all three regards - definitely glad I made the switch!Side note, I am considering an armband for my smartphone because high-quality streaming gets choppy at 15' if I set the phone down and play ball outside.  This is NORMAL for Bluetooth and not what I'd call a product defect, but in the past I've had Moto (S9, S10-HD) models that let me play basketball 30-50' from the handset with no issue, and that's definitely not the case with these.  These headphones seem to like being close to the streaming device, so plan accordingly."
5	:	"Okay, so I was utterly disappointed with my first pair of these headphones. The first one literally fell apart. The rubber was coming off and everything (I think they were defective)However, the funny part is that the buttons were coming out, but the Mic worked perfectly as well as the sound quality. I called into Bose support ( they are actually super super nice and understanding) they emailed me a shipping label.Shortly after I sent in my headphones, I received new ones!! Oh I'm in love. I'm obsessed with these !!They're perfect for weight training, running, as well as calastenic. I highly recommend them, especially after the wonderful customers service I've received. Amazon only warranty this product for a few months. Bose, themself, covers it for a year.(It akso makes talking hand free clear as day :)!!)"
2	:	"It???s been a year since I bought these earphones. At first, they were great! I loved the design, the battery life, and the sound quality. However, I guess they couldn???t take my lifestyle! I work out everyday and used these earphones, but after about 5 months of use they started falling apart. The seal that covered the power button came off and the ear pieces started breaking. The power button was getting harder and harder to press. Granted, I used these everyday and I guess I sweat duribg exercise (I lift weights and do some cardio). But I expected these to be made for exercise and daily use and at least stay in good condition for more than a year.Anyways, I still used them despite the fact that they were falling apart. But after a year, I???ve decided to retire them. Just thought I???d leave a review to let people (especially those who love to work out daily and have a similar lifestyle as mine) know that these aren???t great for long-term, daily use."
5	:	"Worth every penny. Just do it. Stop wasting your time debating if it's worth the $$. YES. It is. I googled it, read all the reviews, slept on it and now with product in hand it seriously puts a smile on my face hearing the music quality. If you love music and love getting lost in the sound this is worth it. The set is secure in your ear, it even has a clip if you're a runner. It comes with 3 size ear pieces so you'll get the custom fit. It's hard for me to spend money on things like this but I'm sold. The sound is amazing. Get lost in the sound!"
5	:	"Skeptical at first, although I'm not sure why I was, Bose makes quality products and the Powerbeats 3 were getting bad reviews. These are wonderful! Sound is clear, and if you pick the correct in ear size of tip, they WILL NOT move during whatever workout you are doing! I run 2 miles + a day in these, and even with sweat in my ear, they stay in place and I can hear great. I also run next to a busy highway and I don't hear the cars either. These are great quality, the ONLY thing I'll say is that the outer ear bud sticks out slightly from your ear, if you like a flatter side, then you may be slightly saddened with these, but the quality and sound make up for it! Thanks Bose!"
1	:	I was tired of wired headphones so I decided to splurge and get a top at the end line wireless headphones for running. The quality was great and they were  very comfortable until one run when the volume just started rising to max level.  Was unbearable and I had to let them just hang for my shirt. Next time I ran it did the same thing at the end of a 3 mile run. After that they didn???t work at all.  I only put in about 9-12 miles a week and don???t run when it rains so there is no excessive use. Not at all what I expected from Bose!
4	:	"These are by far the most comfortable earbuds i've tried.  I've always used the smallest ear cushion on most other wireless earbuds because my ears would hurt after a few hours of use.  I can wear these all day at my desk with zero pain.  They stay put, are easy to take in and out quickly and I never have issues with syncing to my phone like I did with all the others i've tried.  These are worth every penny.  The only thing that sucks is the cheap plastic clothing clip, it will break on you within a month or two of use.  Both my husband and I have these and the clips broke right away."
1	:	Horrible battery life not to mention it's all over the place I can't tell if it's about to die or its at 100% if you put them on the charger even for about 10 minutes It'll say it's at 100% but after about 5 minutes of use it'll be telling you the battery is about to die it will annoyingly repeatedly tell you this at completely random intervals for anywhere from 5 minutes all the way up to 2hours before it finally dies!!!! I listen to podcasts and this is one the most annoying low battery notifications ever it doesn't pause your music and it cuts the audio off as it plays I have had to rewind numerous hours of audio because of this issue! If it weren't a 120 dollars pair of headphones I might be willing to ignore this issue but today I actually got frustrated Because I had to start a podcast over and over again almost a dozen times after the same exact phrase got blanked out by low battery notifications which shortly after actually hearing what I wanted after ten minutes of trying finally stopped and guess what? I got nearly half an hour of no interruptions before it died with not other warning.
4	:	"These earbuds sound great, and are quite comfortable. Since I have hair that goes past my ears, the large size doesn't matter. They don't show at all. I often wear these while riding my bicycle, and like to use them to use map guidance. They work great for that, and because there is no cord, I can leave my phone (iPhone) safely tucked into my bike bag. I like the clip that attaches the cord to my shirt. I've never lost the earbuds, but this gives it a bit more security. The only thing that would be better, is if the battery were a little more long lasting. I will have to look into acquiring the battery case to deal with that issue."
1	:	"I have never posted a product review but feel compelled to advise IPhone X owners to not buy this product. I would give a 0 rating but the review will not let me give a 0. To summarize, initially the product worked great, but after several months, this product suddenly became totally unusable with an iPhone X because of volume issues.The problem is that the maximum volume can now only be heard in a quiet room. If you want to listen to anything with these earphones during a commute, run, at the gym???anywhere but in a basically silent room???forget this piece of junk.  The max volume is way too low to hear anything???and forget about anything less than max.Tho is so disappointing from a recognized and usually reliable brand. I have seen multiple posts re this issue online but no fix exists from what I can tell. It???s difficult for me to understand how this issue cannot be fixed given that the earbuds actually worked (and quite well, with good battery life) for a while."
5	:	"I tried a cheaper pair of $40 wireless headphones first, and the  fit was bad and sound was tinny. I decided to invest a bit and these are amazing.  Perfect fit, you can feel them lock in as you turn them back a little.  They are big but that's ok because they don't wiggle at all. The sound is great, deep bass, clear and as loud as I'd like.  I was able to pair them with my Apple Watch (took a little while to figure that out - I had to walk away from my phone until the headphones released that bluetooth connection, now it pairs immediately with both my phone and my watch).  I'm able to go for a long walk with my wireless headphones and I don't have to bring my phone along.  Amazing freedom!  They have a long battery  life and I like that when you turn on it tells you the battery percentage and what it's connected to.  Love these headphones!"
5	:	Been using these everyday for a year now and I'm glad to have headphones that can actually withstand sweat/water. I was stupid enough to buy 2 sets of beats wireless headphones before these (I replaced what I thought was just a bad unit). Beats are worthless because they break after maybe a month of gym use. Never again.
5	:	"I tried a few sport headphones but none were like these.  This was the most comfortable fit in my ear, with great sound clarity.  It is supposed to let a little outside sound in due to them being for sport, yet they let in just enough so can gear a car or someone talking, but not enough that you will be disturbed.  Battery life is decent as I wear them to the gym and use for about an hour and a half and use between 20-30% of the battery each time, and they are very fast to recharge, so if they die, you can plug them in for a quick boost and will have enough for a quick workout.  Some parts seem they could be fragile, but I try to be gentle with everything and after a dew months, they still look new!"
3	:	"I had originally considered a solid 5 star to this set because of the sound quality, practicality and comfort. I was willing to let go the minor annoyance of the advertised 5hr battery life (my previous set was an LG Tone 910 with an impressive 10hr play time) but recently this set doesn't charge to more than 90% I bought them and used them on a daily back in November 2017 (only 6 months ago) and whatever is able to charge only last for about 3 hrs of play time.Other than the battery slowly dying on me; I still love the sound quality and noise reduction on the mic when I'm on the phone; that said, when is time to replace this set, I will look elsewhere."
5	:	"These are great headphones for working out. Much better than the Jaybirds X2 and Powerbeats2 I had previously. They stay in the ear and are very comfortable. The sounds is awesome for bluetooth workout headphones. Enough bass for Rap/R&B and rich mids for rock and pop. You may have a hard time with the tips if you have small ears. They come with multiple sizes,but the small may not be small enough for some."
4	:	"So these are awesome.  They produce great quality music, and the way they designed it makes it comfortable and secure in your ear.  It cancels out most of the background noise around you (not all of it) so your music sounds crisper and more immersive, and if you are talking to anyone their voices are clear.  If you sweat ALOT then they start to fall out a little bit, but for the most part they stayed in and work well for almost all of my intense workouts.  These are probably the best headphones I've purchased in terms of sound quality.  I take a star away on these because after having these for a little under a year they began to go bad.  The Bluetooth connection went wonky, and the sound quality began to get worse.  They were under warranty so i'm getting a replacement, but I wonder if it will happen again with the next pair."
2	:	"These headphones generally work as described, but I???ve had issues with the batteries, which is quite disappointing given the price. First, these headphones die faster than advertised. I timed it, and my pair goes from full to empty after 3 hours of listening to music. Second, the voice ???reports??? about the remaining battery percentage seem off (or the battery itself is wonky). For example, the other day my headphones went from ???20%??? to dead in about one minute. All in all, these are fine and very portable, but given the unreliable batteries, I???d recommend checking out other options before splurging on these.EDIT: The battery life seems to be getting even shorter! I timed it, and they went from 100% to dead after 70 minutes of listening to music. I'm going to try to return these headphones. I hate having to recharge them repeatedly during a single study session. Perhaps this is a flaw with my pair specifically, but they are simply not worth the price."
2	:	"I have couple of Bose products and its works very well, since I bought them (10+ years). This head phones has some serious flaws and it should have been caught during testing (looks like testing work outsource to China  :) ) .Issue #1 : If you are listening to music and at the same time you are on GPS Map (Waze). Sound volume keep changing. I was driving for hour and half; I have to adjust my volume 20 times (annoying).Issue #2 :  I was on my iPhone using Bose Headphone and its disconnected few time during my 1 hours meeting. I thought its my phone signal. I switch to other bluetooth headset and it all works fine.I can't believe Bose launch this kind of product in market at a price $149 + tax. I never had  an issue with my plantronics (using from last 3 years)Last Notes: If you are using ONLY for exercise, its good. Sound quality is pretty good and gives some sort of noise cancellation. Don't expect more than that. Thats why I rated as 2 star."
2	:	"Just wanted to give a long-term review of this product after using it for 9 months.For the most part, I've been happy with these ear buds. I generally use them 3-4 times a week when taking phone calls or going for bike rides. The sound quality is good, the wind noise is not to bad when I'm riding my bike (I don't have to blast my music and can still hear traffic around me), and people can hear me really well when I'm on calls.However, the battery as always been the issue with these ear buds. After about 2 months I started running into problems where I'd start with a full charge and 30 minutes later I'd start getting low battery warnings. If I plugged in to charge, the led would turn green a minute later. After that I might get two hours of use out of it, but then again I might only get another 30 minutes -- I could never tell how long the battery would last. After updating the firmware with the mobile app things seemed a little more consistent, but then it would always fall back to the old behavior.Now after 9 months of usage, the battery has completely given up while my 3 year old Bose Sound Link headphones are still going strong. I get that lipo's get old and eventually die, but I expected more from a Bose product."
4	:	"Bose sound is always Bose sound that is 5Star. I have many headphones and radios etc. Now this one was great until I went to the gym, left in the car in summer and all the plastic skin got loose and tiny buttons to turn it on and off and volume up and down fall. They are replacing it as they are under warranty.Again BOSE is always BOSE, sound is still unmatched amongst other brands!"
5	:	"My God, these headphones are absolutely the BEST!!! Bose never fails to live up to their reputation.  The sound is superior and it took only 5 minutes to set up (after watching the video on their site.) I charged them via my laptop and it took only 2 hours. Love that they included 3 sets of earpieces (small & large -- medium are already attached.) I love R&B, Pop and Classical music and these headphones really brought the music alive.  Love them.  Wish I could afford to purchase another pair for my sister - oh well :)"
5	:	"I love these earphones! Previously I only used wired headphones, but thought I would upgrade to these and haven't looked back since! Here are my pros and cons of the earphones:Pros-Amazing sound, highs-mids-lows are very well balanced as well as fantastic bass.-Battery lasts a long time, forgot what the exact hours are but Ive never had a problem of them dying too quickly.-Listened to them almost everyday for almost a whole year, and still work just as good as they did on day 1-Easily connects to devices, and can even switch devices with the push of the button.-Stays in ear very well, never falls out or feels uncomfortable.-High quality build, doesn't feet cheap or plasticy.Cons:-The little clip to attach to your shirt would become detached every once in a while, if I turned too much or took them off without unclipping it first.-Easy to lose clip if not put on properly, but you honestly dont need it unless youre doing something really intense and are rolling on the ground...-Will sometimes have problems with being connected to two devices at once, like music playing on one with totally shut out the other, even when music is paused.Thats about it! Definitely recommend these earphones, superior build and sound quality for a great price!"
5	:	"Despite having a relatively large profile and sticking out of the ear quite a ways, this is the first set of bluetooth earphones I've owned that boast good enough sound quality for my ears.  I tried the Jaybirds, I tried the Jabras, and honestly they sounded like I would expect bluetooth headphones would sound: lifeless with anemic bass and uninteresting signature.While these are by no means reference-quality sound, they have a fun signature, a surprising amount of bass, and they get loud enough to keep your music audible over a noisy environment.  The only downside is that they're not completely closed, so there is some sound leak, and that may not lend itself to a quiet office environment, for example.Note: If you're trying to decide between these and their completely wireless brethren, know that the wireless ones cut out if you turn your head too much with your phone in your pocket."
5	:	"My first Bose product, and must say, I love it. The sound quality is too good, with literally everything. The best part, you don't need to work on an app to customize it, Bose does it for you. Full marks to Bose for the sound quality.I love the looks, durability and the fit. I had some issues initially making it stay in my ears, but now it works great. Battery lasts for around 7 hours, and the charging is fast. Best part, it connects to iPhone as well as my Mac, and I can take the call while pausing video on Mac, without the need to switch every time.Pricey. yes, but Bose is worth it."
4	:	"After a ton of research, I went with Bose.  Top competitors were the Jaybird X3's, which I have not tried. I've never written an Amazon review before but since competition is so steep with these products I thought I'd try and be helpful for you guys. I got these on Cyber Monday sale for $99 a few weeks ago.I've known and loved Bose products for a long time now, and while my decision wasn't pure brand loyalty I knew these would be solid. They are. I use them for NYC commuting, at work, and in the gym. Great performance in all uses.PROS:-Sound quality is excellent. Music sounds great. No surprise there. Clear, punchy, true. Really enjoyable. Enormous step up from the stock iPhone buds I upgraded from, and assume most reading this review will be making the same step. No comparison. Treat yourself.-Call quality: this was a big one for me as I wanted to use these for work (sales, lots of calls.) Everyone I've asked has told me that the receiving end of a call on these is clear, as long as the mic is in the right position on my face. The wire can be positioned in front or back of your head; calls don't work as well if they're tucked back, though it is nice to do that and clip them to your collar while on the move.-Fit: i'm happy wearing these for a while with the out-of-the-box earpieces; they're comfortable but they also come with multiple other options to adjust the fit. I am a rock climber and they don't fall out at any angle.-Battery: while these have an objectively lower battery life than the competitors, I find that they still get me through a full work day as long as I stay on top of turning them on/off as I use them. I commute to work in NYC, listen to them on the train and use them for calls and music at work. They're still going when I walk in the door at the end of the day, and are easy enough to charge overnight.CONS:-Size. These suckers are big. If you'd like to wear earmuffs in the winter or a hat over them, you're not going to have much luck. They stick out enough to preclude most headgear, though visually they're not cramping your style much. I don't really care because they sound great, but my ears are cold.-Connectivity - they cut in and out a good bit, with music and calls skipping. I was surprised at how often this happens. You often have to juggle what they're connected to. Between a work phone, personal phone, work computer and personal computer they often get confused and connect / disconnect at random. They can be connected to only two things at once. This is completely fine as long as you're deliberate about what they're hooked up to. But they also drop a half-second of music or phone call every now and then, which is disappointing.Overall I'm happy with my purchase, but am open to trying the competitors in the future. I highly recommend them for causal and professional use."
3	:	"I bought these with high expectations. The sound quality is amazing, the remote that is on the wire is very handy. it pairs very easily with my iphone and apple watch. As soon as I turn them on, it pairs. They stay in my ears and never slip or fall out. I wear them while working out and basically 6 + hours while working. Now for the down sides, they take about 2 hours to charge and the battery lasts about 6 hours. so if you are going to wear them all day be prepared to go without for a couple of hours. Also, I have only had them for about 6 months and they are starting to fall apart. there are some cylinder pieces around the cord where it attaches to the ear buds its self, that the glue has worn off and those cylinders now move up and down on the cord(I think they are there to keep the cord from fraying, so not a huge deal besides aesthetics) also there is a piece of rubber or some other material where the power button is that has also lost the adhesive of the glue. I wrote an email to product support and got the generic reply that it would be answered in 2 business days. I didn't get a response for a whole month. I don't know if they are planning on replacing them or what."
2	:	"Sadly, I will be returning these. The sound is as expected from a Bose product. However, the volume has a lot to be desired. Everyone who knows YouTube knows the volume of the videos vary greatly. Most headphones can compensate for that. These did not. With the volume all the way up, some videos were still not up to par. Also, the fit of these were lacking. They were not secure and I couldn't run with them because they would shake right out with about 100 yards. I tried the larger and smaller ear pieces with the same result and a lot of discomfort. This was very frustrating and disappointing especially considering the cost. I've had better earphones that cost a fraction of what these did. Sooooo Bose if you're reading this... Do better."
4	:	Well after going through over 2 dozen different styles and types of ear buds looking for sound quality Bose came throughEverything I tried wa  either all bass and no treble or all treble and no bass.Looking for a clean smooth full range sound is a lot harder than I ever imagined and when I was about to give up all hope i found the Bose SoundSport  wireless earbud style headphones.One thing that was not good was the many reports of the control switch coming apart from the seam.But I'm hoping if I only use the phones basic sound controls and not touch the problemed control switch at all it should not be a problem.
4	:	"Just got these and couldn't wait to try them out, they are comfortable, sounds it amazing, they are not super loud so I might try a Beat to compare sounds but so far I like them. Oh I tested out the battery and it last quiet long, used them straight for 8 hours at work and when took them off they still had 30% battery so that is definitely a plus, walked away from my cell and they stayed connected pretty far once I walked back they connected again by themselves, one time I walked and stayed away for a little bit and they automatically shutoff (didn't get the timing since I didn't know it was going to do that) but I will update with more info as I still have to try them at the gym ????"
5	:	"The Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones are fantastic!  And what is with the complaints of batter life?  You can turn them off when you store them.Here is my schedule Monday - Battery 100%; used them for 1 hr on the treadmill,Tuesday - Battery 90%; used them for 1 hr on the tread mill,Wednesday - stored on my vanity,Thursday - Battery 84%; used them for 1 hr on the treadmill,Fri - Sun - stored on my vanity,Monday - Battery 70%; used them for 1 hr on the treadmill.I don't know why you'd buy another brand.  Totally recommend."
3	:	"I really like the idea of wireless earbuds. I am a musician and have had years of really great headphone experiences. Up until this Bose set, my only experience with earbuds has been with the ones that come with iPhones. I have been impressed with Boses' technology for years, so I thought they would make a really great set of earbuds. I have to say that I'm not impressed at all- and $129.00! I don't think they're any better than ibuds. The stereo separation, the imaging, etc., just doesn't even compare to a decent set of AKG, Sennheiser, or Sony headphones. And, then there's the battery. Ridiculous short life. Very disappointed!"
5	:	"I???ve had this set for about 2 weeks. The sound quality is Bose excellent! It???s easy to use. Easy to pair. Battery life exceeds ALL the many other Bluetooth earbuds I???ve bought; at least 5 different ones. But the range has been unbelievable! I listen to music most of the day. Often I???ll leave my phone on my desk, walk down the hallway; through 3 doorways in interior walls still listening to my music! It???s amazing. They were worth the cost! Every other set I have would barely let me get out of visual distance of the phone, maybe one small room away!"
4	:	"Pros:Uses a regular micro usbVery light weightHeadphones tell you the battery life upon power onGood quality soundUpgradeable firmware with the Bose Connect phone AppVery easy to feel your way across the buttonsButtons actually work with android (amazon music, spotify, google play)7hr battery life1yr warranty thru boseExtremely water/sweat resistantCons:Connecting cable is long (for me)Buttons are a little firmExpensive"
3	:	"I loved my first pair of Bose headphones so I was naturally excited to try out the wireless SoundSport for working out. I was disappointed twice by this product. After taking them out of the box I tried them on and immediately noticed I had to put the volume at about 80% to hear the music. So for working out I had to almost max out the volume. The first time I used the headphones I had charged them overnight, the ???siri??? told me they were at 100% when I got to the gym and they just clicked off without warning.So I returned these ones and tried the replacement pair for two weeks. I just kept trying to remind myself that they are a good brand and rather expensive so they ???should be high quality??? rather than enjoying the headset. The volume was one thing, but the second bothersome factor was the battery decreased by 10% every time I turned them on. It didn???t matter if I worked out for 30 minutes for 2 hours.I truly want to love these headphones, but had to return them again. Trying out a different and less expensive brand for now!"
4	:	"I was really excited to replace my previously stolen headphones with this nearly wireless pair, I run in the gym every day as well as cycle so I certainly appreciate the Bluetooth aspect and they don???t slip off my ears like my over-ear sports ones I had before did. I also have fairly sensitive ears as in the regular iPhone earbuds make my ears ache after maybe 30-40 minutes of use, I notice no issues whatsoever with the Bose headphones even after hours of use, they???re very comfortable.Pros: Comfort, sound quality is excellent, lightweight, considering the size and how small the battery must be the battery life is pretty good, quality construction and they are easy to set up and use. The colour choices are cool, I get asked a lot about them by people.Cons: Price is on the higher side unless you get them on sale, the microphone is too sensitive... when I???m in the gym a lot of people I talk to complain that a treadmill spinning or people dropping weights in the distance is deafening to them but my voice isn???t as loud so it seems to pick up the wrong audio.I???m happy with them and expect to use them for a long time."
4	:	"Had these earbuds since April and use them 3-4 times a week for .45 minutes...still sound great, battery life continues to exceed expectations, and only had to buy replacement ear loops. I thought I'd be upgrading to the truly wireless version, but as good as these have been it will be a while! If a tiny cord doesn't bother you, buy these and save a few bucks. You will really love the fit and the sound!You will be pleasantly surprised how well these fit and sound. I admit I was skeptical, having always had over the ear loops on my headphones. It takes a few times, but you'll get very used to and like how these go in your ear snugly and stay there. I'm more of a run-jogger but am glad I don't have to constantly adjust these. Oh, and some people have whined about the sound quality...what? I'm not talking tin-can nor Carnegie hall here, but they are closer to the latter. Clear sound, nice bass, and pretty easy to adjust the sound. AND THE BATTERY LASTS PRETTY LONG. I've done 15 45 minute sessions and charge them about every 4th or 5th jog. So, you get Bose quality, nice fit, decent battery, and a cool little carrying case for travel or so you can protect them in your bag, briefcase or purse. Buy 'em. You'll be pleasantly surprised."
4	:	"I love not needing to deal with a regular cord. It doesn't get caught on anything.Occasionally, the bluetooth or sound quality act up. The best solution I found is to forget/unpair the device completely and set it back up from scratch through the pairing process. One time that solution didn't fix it, but it was working after I charged it and left it alone for the night.The sound quality isn't as good as wired earphones, but that doesn't matter much to me. For me, the convenience drastically outweighs the cut in sound quality. Not for my dad - he'll stick with wired Bose earphones for now.The Bose Connect app is handy. You'll want to use it to update the firmware on these earphones as soon as you get them."
5	:	These replaced a pair of Bose (wired) SoundSport earphones that conked out after two years of abuse.  The sound quality of these wireless earphones is definitely superior.  I also own a pair of (wired) Bose QC20i noise cancelling earphones and the sound quality of these wireless earphones is near or equal to that of the QC20i.  (These reports used an iPhone or iPod as sources playing either pre-recorded music or Pandora.)  I was skeptical given past experiences and the bandwidth constraints of Bluetooth but it looks like the Bose engineers got their compression algorithms and equalizers down pat.I also tested the heart rate monitor alongside the reliable and accurate Polar brand chest strap wireless heart rate monitor that came with my exercise machine and the two matched almost perfectly throughout a 45-minute workout.
5	:	"The usual Bose premium price aside, these sweat-resistant bluetooth earbuds put out some very impressive sound.  I purposefully did not purchase the noise reduction model as I use these in the gym and while hiking, and so I like to be able to hear what's going on around me (especially when walking on or near the streets in our neighborhood).  The sound from these earbuds is very rich and full, with surprisingly good bass response for in-canal earbuds.  They are able to reach volume levels that are potentially damaging to your hearing, and so you should be careful about how high you crank them up.  I am aware that there have been complaints regarding deterioration of the rubber cover over the volume/pause control buttons, but this has not been a problem for me, so far.  Also, as others have noted, the little clip that connects the cable to your shirt ""disappeared"" a long time ago.  However, as this has not caused any problems for me, I have not replaced the clip.  As a side note regarding the water and sweat resistance of these earbuds, a number of people people have asked whether or not they are truly waterproof.  As Bose does NOT guaranatee that they are truly waterproof (although they are designed to be ""sweat resistant""), I will say that I inadvertently left them in the pocket of a pair of sweat pants, and so they went through the washer and dryer.  To my surprise, they emerged from that experience just fine, and they continue to function normally (although I would not recommend that you repeat my misadventure, as any damage caused by washing and drying them will not be covered by the manufacturer's warranty)."
5	:	"Had my doubts about these. Never liked earbuds, never paid this much for headphones. These bud have been a life changer. They stay connected up to something like 50 feet, so I can leave my phone on a table in my house and take care of my work anywhere around the house without a hiccup. They stay in my ears when I'm running and don't have the hassle of a cord, so I'm spending way more time on the pavement.  I've never had this sound quality out of a set of headphones. I have other Bose products, and I'm happy they kept true to the brand. Spend the time when you get to install the app and update the firmware. Solves that weird battery level issue.Also, the charging case works great."
5	:	"I love these. They sound great. They're very comfortable to wear. They have never fallen out, and I've never had any connection issues. I use these both while at the office and when I'm outside with my dog, playing fetch, running around or walking a few miles. The battery life isn't as impressive as some other brands, but I've never had a problem with them dying - a quick recharge during lunch and they're ready to go for the rest of the afternoon, if I want to wear them all day at work.The two drawbacks are definitely the size and battery life. Everything else is great. The size isn't an issue as far as comfort or security - they are extremely comfortable and have never been close to falling out. They just stick out of your ears more than some brands. The battery life has still been plenty sufficient for me, but I'm a rechargeaholic so pretty conscientious about keeping things charged. If you're not, you may see some benefit in a different pair with better battery life."
5	:	"These headphones sound amazing. I had the jabra sports and the bose are far superior. Worth every penny. The comfort is unreal, and more secure than it feels. I can run and lift at the gym with no problems. After 30-45 min the jabra in ear starts to hurt, but the Bose I can wear for hours. Yes it lacks the seal of a true in ear but it doesn't bother me at all. The sound quality and bass is perfect. Your not just paying for the name , it truly is quality. Others I've tried include skullcandy, beats on ear, apple buds, sennheiser, and shure."
3	:	"I wanted to love these, because of the top notch sound quality.  However, they have trouble connecting to my iDevices - most likely because they do not have the W1 Chip in them that is designed specifically for iDevices.  Maybe its and Apple thing, maybe a Bose thing, but Apple and Bose have to get together and figure this out - put the W1/W2/W3 chips in all Bose headphones and this should fix the connection problems.  As it is, I fight every time I turn them on to properly connect to my iWatch 3, then, once they are connected, they cut out periodically."
3	:	"I bought these 7 months ago and have put them through their paces both casually and during some high intensive work outs.Pros: The thing I LOVE about these headphones is that they are comfortable. I've tried Jaybirds and Beats ear buds before and they always seemed to fit rather oddly. I always had to shove those in and force them to stay in my ears. These have a very comfortable rubber fitting that lets them sit IN your ears and stay in. The cable isn't a  dangling mess and the connection is quick and seamless.Cons: There's quite a few and I will rank them on their impact on my usage.5. The on-phone software: Bose's app is really just a way for me to update the earbuds firmware whenever one gets pushed out. It really doesn't do much besides the advertised music sharing app where it can link to another Bose headset and play audio on both devices, which i never found a use for so i cant vouch for how that works.4. The case. The case is pretty puny and fits the earbuds, i just wish we got something more rugged so that i can confidently throw them in and throw them in my bag. I've pretty much gotten rid of it because it's just not seamless enough for me when i leave the house.3. The volume. These headphones produce decent volume during casual use and sound quality is okay but they let in ALOT of background noise especially when you're at a gym. I wouldn't normally be so picky about this but since they are marketed as fitness headphones and aren't cheap, I'm afraid I have to dock significant points off it. Louder genres of music works just okay enough for me at the gym but you will be hearing the garbage gym playlist off in the distance and you can just forget about enjoying podcasts, movies, or anything  with ""softer"" sounds as it's almost impossible.2. Battery Life. My second least favorite thing about these buds are battery life. When I first got them it felt like i could get around 6-7 hours of consecutive on time as i would wear them through the work day and listen to podcasts/music and charge them for about 20 minutes on my drive to the gym to get another 2 hours for the gym. Now i'm lucky to get 4 hours and the charge time is unpredictable. Sometimes I get another 2 hours off a 20 minute charge sometimes i barely get another 20 minutes. Borderline unacceptable and they will eventually become gym only buds because of this.1. Battery Life indicator: If the battery life wasn't bad enough. It's the onboard battery indicator thats the most frustrating thing about these. When you turn them on a little voice tells you how much percentage it has. I started noticing about 4 months in that the battery indicator and the actual battery life was not  in sync. I would charge them all night and put them on to hear battery life 60% or sometimes i would put them on at the end of the day and hear battery life 80% then get a battery low notification while im at the gym and SOMETIME's I would get a battery low notification and I would test to see how long they last and I end up squeezing another 2-3 hours. Unless i have this thing charged for a significant amount of time, I can't trust them.If it wasn't for the battery issue which may or may not be exclusive to my unit, I would give these a solid 4 stars even with the volume problem and recommend them to anyone. But these issues have lately tempted me to seek another pair from a different brand. I really wish I could like them but as it stands I can't suggest anybody spend money on these unless they are discounted significantly."
5	:	"I tried several headphones before, but this one is the best so far. It was very easy to set up, and the sound quality is fantastic, like a Bose should be.But updating my review after 9 months, I have to say that I am disappointed with the life of this product. The battery just doesn't hold the charge more than 45 min. However, I contacted Bose and I found out the product was still in the warranty period of 1 year. They replaced the unit by a new one. Great customer service."
4	:	"I love Bose. The sound quality on these are amazing for a wireless headset. But the design has clear flaws: (1) the wire is quite thick and so if you turn your head, you can feel the wire pulling on the ear buds. Thankfully the earbuds fit really well for me so they do not fall out, but the wire protrudes at a weird angle and it takes getting used to. (2) Other people talk about how the buds stick out of your ear and look weird. They are correct. They reallllly stick out of your ear and look super funny. But I only wear them at the gym so I don't care what other people think.tl;dr - Amazing sound, ugly design, wire can pull on earbuds sometimes."
4	:	"The good:  these headphone connect and reconnect flawlessly with Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Ipod), which make them a pleasure to use.  The mediocre:  presumably because of the bandwidth limitation of Bluetooth compared to a wired connection, these headphones do not have the same sound quality that the wired SoundSport headphones provide.  Specifically, when listening to a high quality ALAC file, the sound quality is reduced to about that of a medium quality MP3 file.  Also, as expected, these are larger and heavier than the wired versions.  The ugly:  the associated phone app provides a few important features, such as providing a mechanism for firmware updates.  However, the penalty is the default setting that apparently sends Bose information that they don't need about your content (!).  They provide an option, after the initial installation, to change the privacy settings and one should do so.  In summary, these headphones are exactly what they claim to be and work exactly as expected."
5	:	These are amazing.  I usually buy Bose products for the superb sound and I'm very satisfied with these.  They stay firmly in my ear (using the large earpieces for me).  And obviously the sound quality is amazing.  To keep them in the ear the secret is to twist them backwards in the ear so that the top plastic end is tilted backwards.  The best thing about these headphones is that they connect instantly to my phone.  My other Bluetooth devices take anywhere from 5 to 15 seconds to connect.  This connects in less than a second.  Plus it tells you what its charge level is when you turn it on.  These are super-nice - I have taken them on many runs and have not had a single problem.
3	:	"Weird problems.I really enjoy the other Bose products I have, so got these headphones hoping for great quality, even though they are kind of a sticky-outy and awkward form factor.My two main issues are: on phone calls (not a problem for music or podcasts) the voice of the person i am talking to goes in and out (sounds muffled), I've experimented, and this does not happen on the same call with other headphones; second, the charging can be weird. Just now I've been trying to charge them but they keep spontaneously connecting to my computer's bluetooth and preventing me from using my wired headphones that I am actually trying to use with my computer.Good things: Once I found the right size they stay in well, charges super fast, the case works well and has a nice carabiner, the jacket clip has not fallen off yet despite its seemingly precarious attachment, sound is good, playback time is long enoughNit-picky 'i-took-a-design-class' issues: my hair catches on the ear 'buds' (more accurately the ear blossoms) all the time (brief rant: does user testing for joined wireless headphones not include people with long hair??? i see the same issues in a lot of headphones. why do you think it's so great to have a wire that goes around the back of my neck, and then plan for how i will drape it over my shoulders when not in use? I won't use it that way because that is where my hair is. Similarly, the surface finish on these headphones grabs my hair all of the time); the weight of the ear bud is pretty far away from my ear socket, meaning a light touch creates a large enough moment for the earbud to seem insecure in my ear, even though they tend not to fall out, this is more just annoying; they stick out really far and look ridiculous, again this makes me think they user-tested mostly men, because these headphones look kind of ridiculous with smaller ears, but then again who cares"
1	:	"My Bose wireless headphones, not even after a month of using, the glue between the rubber cover and the blue plastic body just give up and these two parts are disconnected now, I used this headphones very carefully. But now since it couldn't even hold up for a month, I have to return it and ask for a refund.You can see in the picture down below, the light is leaking from the gap that is not suppose be there at all."
3	:	"Love the comfort of these. They fit in my ears perfectly and I don't spend any time adjusting them or fidgeting with them. They stay in place and feel comfortable. They buds come in 3 sizes so should fit just about everyone. Also, the sound quality is good on these, as to be expected by Bose products. However, two major cons are the volume and  battery life. These just do not get very loud. I've heard rumors they do this intentionally so that you can hear your surroundings like cars, but as a 35 yo adult, I think I should be able to make these types of safety decisions. They just do not get very loud which is annoying when you're doing mundane cardio or lifting. I'm pretty sure my cheap stock apple iphone headphones (the white ones) go louder. Second, the battery life on these is not great. For a wireless product, that's a problem. If i don't remember to charge these after every 2-3 uses (which is only for 1-2 hour at a time), they're dead. Also, whenever I charge for hours and take them off, they always say they are charged at 80% or 90%. No idea why they don't charge to 100% after being left overnight on the charger.So 5 starts for comfort and sound quality, but since I use these primarily for running and lifting, volume and battery life are essentials that trump sound quality. For what it's worth, if I could give these 3.5 stars, I would."
5	:	"Great sound from these small earbuds.  They twist in easily and are super comfortable for my small ears.  I have tried numerous earbuds and never found a good fit.  I use these running on the trail, in the gym, or around the house.  They are not noise canceling, but they will drown out just about everything.  Several rubber ear pieces to fit any size ear too.  Great product for the price, and stays charged longer than the product reviews state.  Carrying case comes in very handy for gym goers like myself."
1	:	"I have ordered 5 of these and the ""inline"" control button comes undone making them useless. I have had one fixed in the past and need support getting this resolved as this happened to new ones I purchased June this year. I have never had this happen so quickly and take great care since they are costly. Hopefully I can get this resolved for a better review of the product."
5	:	"I don't understand the negative reviews posted. These fit in the ear better than any other earpods that I have used. And believe me I have tried many. The sound is fantastic. I use them with my Apple watch when exercising. That way I don't have to carry my phone with me. As far as how well they hold up, only time will tell."
2	:	"Weird fit in the ear (takes lots of fiddling to insert correctly), discharges very fast, the ""on"" button is VERY hard to push (have to use your nail - finger pressure isn't enough.) The sound - the reason I bought them in the first place - is nothing special; frankly, I've ended up using my $50 JVC wireless headphones by default. For this price, I expect a top-notch product - and these fall well short of that."
5	:	"My first Bose! Been waiting since I was a teen to buy Bose. This are superb! Great fit, build quality, connection to my PC took a little work....but now is fine. The sound quality is what I expected, and more...one almost drawback is that they are so perfectly clear if your music is of a lower quality you will hear every hiss and crack. Bass is sharp, crisp, and can rumble with the best. Mids are clear, and highs are equally as good. Its true the Bose software is basic, but I believe there are no enhancements because A: this sounds great! B: perhaps its is to protect the speakers. Love you Bose!"
4	:	I have had these headphones since black friday last year when they went on sale and they are the best ear buds I've owned but is also the most expensive as well. These have lasted the longest but overtime the material starts wearing off the ear buds. The high quality sound is worth it. The battery was lasting pretty well but overtime the battery seems to die faster but it probably depends on how much you use it. I'm not sure if i would upgrade to the new ear only buds. It seems too small that be easy to lose it. They should just create a more durable material so it last longer
4	:	"The audio quality on these is very acceptable.  I don't wear these for strenuous workouts, mainly walking/running at the park and mowing the lawn.  I only every use these with my phone or watch.  I tried to pair them with my Windows machine but the sound was very off and I never looked further into it as I have a nice pair of wired headphones.  The battery life is good enough for a few workout sessions, and the size of the earbuds aren't too bad, but part of me wishes they were slightly smaller.  Overall they are very comfortable and I'm happy with my purchase as of a year and a couple months."
5	:	"The headphones are awesome. I have owned the PowerBeats2, LG Tone Infinims, and the Bose corded earbuds as well. These sound 10 times better than the PowerBeats2. These have such clear crisp sound, and amazing bass...I was shocked getting such quality from a bluetooth earbud set. They also stay in your ear very well. I have used them at the gym and for yardwork and never had a problem with them falling out. The only thing I don't like is how large they are and how they stick out of your ear so far. Looks a little ridiculous, but the smaller they get the less sound quality and power they will have, so its a wash."
2	:	"I purchased my Bose SoundSport Wireless headphones about 6 months ago.  When I first got them, they were great.  The sound quality on them is very good.  It's very well balanced, with good bass that does not distort at higher volume levels.  The cord has a good thickness to it.  The actual tips are very comfortable and I have no problem with them falling out of my ears, no matter what I am doing.The issues I ran into have to do with the remote and the cover for the charging port.  The buttons are covered by one piece of formed rubber.  After about 2 1/2 months of use, the rubber began to deform on the pause/play button, and then began lifting off around the edge.  Thinking I had a defective remote, I called Bose customer service (who by the way, were awesome), and I sent them back for a new pair.I received them about 2 weeks later.  I began using them again and now 3 months later, I am having the same issue,  I have attached a photo.  Additionally, the cover for the usb charger no longer stays flush, and keeps on popping open.In all fairness I understand these were made for exercising.  I use these as my everyday headphones, so maybe I am putting more wear and tear on them than they were made for.If you are using these just for exercise, then they are great.  As I said it has good sound quality, and once you put them in your ears, you will be hard pressed to get them to fall out.  As an everyday pair of headphones they do not stand up to constant use, at least in my case."
2	:	"I would give this a solid 5 however there is a few minor things that need improvement. Especially how much you pay for it... I originally had Jlab audio j buds which were given to me and you can???t beat that price which is free. However the fins were incredibly uncomfortable and once in a blue moon I would get this piercing feedback that made my head spin. I???m 25 years old and don???t need hearing problems. The soundsport is definitely a winner in comparison to the jlabs however I feel that the connection Bluetooth range is better with the jlabs. Second the soundsport clip absolutely annoys the fire out of me. I???m having a hard time keeping it on the headphones itself however it will clip to anything because it is so strong. So strong I had accidentally put it through the washer and dryer and it was still clipped to my shirt. I just wish they had designed this a little better so that when I rip my headphones off, the clip will go with it. The jlabs clip rarely had a issue simply because it was designed differently. I absolutely love the tips on the soundsport. People say that they look heavy but the tips are durable and comfortable that I???ve never had a issue of it being too heavy or falling out. Overall I really do like these headphones in comparison to what I previously had. Like with the jlabs, I wear the soundsports constantly. Through out my workday and minimum of a hour at the gym and have had no issues of it falling apart.Update 6/26/2018:Starting to get upset with this purchase. I???ve had these headphones fully charged and within minutes the battery is less than 30%... WHAT THE HECK?! I feel ripped off now."
4	:	They sound great. They stay in my ears very well after learning to twist slightly after inserting them. The two things I do not like about them is that the bluetooth signal is too weak. The signal will not cross my body. I normally wear a music player on my left arm and the right ear piece is what controls everything on these so the bluetooth receiver is in the right ear piece. It will lose reception occasionally. I put the player on my right arm and everything is fine. I have read this is an issue many times. Bose needs to up their bluetooth signal.
5	:	"Bose SoundSport HeadphonesWho are they for?The Bose SoundSport Headphones are designed for the active user in mind. They are headphones that are connected via bluetooth making them wireless. This eliminates the annoying cable problem that comes with most headphones when working out. They are perfect for anyone who is regularly active and on the go.Sound:Bose is known for providing exceptional sound quality with their products. The Bose SoundSports continue to hold this high pedigree. They produce highly detailed sound, with great punchy bass. This allows you to better focus on your workout, and get better results. Also I found them great for watching movies or TV.Comfort:These headphones are in ear headphones, meaning they rest inside your ear. The design features a fin that wraps around your ear.  Thanks to this design, they are always secure no matter what you???re doing. They also come with three different sizes so you can find what???s best for you. These headphones are so comfortable that I often forget that I have them in.Durability:The Bose SoundSports are water and sweat resistant. So you can wear them when it???s raining, or when you are doing cardio.Features:These headphones have the latest bluetooth technology, providing great connectivity to your device. There is also an app just for these headphones that makes connecting even easier. They also feature an inline remote that allows you to pause, skip, and adjust volume of your music.Battery:The headphones have a battery life of around 6 to 7 hours of use per charge. For me that was about 3 days of use, which I found to be great. This meant I didn???t need to charge them constantly."
1	:	"I really liked these until the battery stopped working after having them for about 12 months.  Now a charge barely lasts for 30 minutes - not quite the promised six hours.  I also had a hard time keeping them in my ears while running - despite trying the different inserts provided to keep them in your ear, I would constantly have to readjust them while running, as one of the ear buds while always slowly work its way out."
3	:	"I've been using these about two months now and I do like them, but I hate the loose cord on them. I come from using wireless bluetooth headphones for my athletic stuff that fits tighter to my neck. The only reason I notice this is my long hair is typically up in a ponytail in the gym and i'm constantly having to pull the cord a little to adjust it so it's not pulling the bud out of my ear, or has it feeling like it's going to. The combination of long hair, ponytails and the weight of the hair with this cord is pretty much lame in my world. I can see I'll save these for more of the noise cancelling action like flights and travels and probably pick up a cheap pair of bluetooth for the gym so I'm not thinking about my headphones when I'm trying to focus on my muscles and performance."
3	:	"They sound fine, not great.  The mic died after a few months which was annoying.  Then after 14 months of ownership they died.  They have a 1 year warranty in the US and 2 in the EU.The best part is they are comfortable and don't actually go in your ear.  They do a great job of staying connected unlike the QuietControl 30 which only maintain connection if you don't move.They don't seal well so if you're at the gym and people are talking next to you expect to hear it.  For some that's annoying, for others who want to hear around you it's a good thing."
2	:	"I have been a fan of Bose since I bought their Acoustimass home theater speakers nearly 20 years ago. Their noise cancelling QC20i's go unrivaled as far as earbud-style noise cancelling headphones, and their stayhear tips are the best and most comfortable earbuds I have ever used.  When I considered headphones for the gym, I shied away from any other manufacturer because Bose quality and customer service had always been on par with any other company.I'm writing this review because of my recent experience with Bose customer service and the struggles of receiving warranty replacement headphones.  I contacted them on July 10 because my earbuds were not working - they sent me another pair that were defective right out of the box - I contacted them again and they agreed to overnight me another pair. 2 days later I still didn't get them.  I called again and their excuse was something in the supply chain went wrong and the warehouse somehow didn't get the notification.  The next day (Friday) I still didn't get confirmation that the earbuds shipped so I called and found out that the order was processed but the headphones were not actually handed off to UPS.  And Bose's contract w/ UPS doesn't cover weekend pickups/deliveries.  So now they won't be picked up until Monday (at the earliest) and best case scenario, probably delivered Tuesday the 24th.I train 6 days a week and having wireless headphones is an important component of my training for focus and motivation.  At most I should have been without these headphones for 1 day if Bose didn't keep dropping the ball - but now I will be without functioning headphones for 14+ days. To be honest, this is the last Bose product I will ever buy. They are great products - when they work - but I can't deal with the hassle of calling multiple times to ensure they're doing their job - the frustration of finding out that they haven't shipped the product on time.  The days I have gone without something I use every day. For $150, buy something from a company that gets things done - not one that you have to spend hours on the phone with trying to get a simple warranty replacement.I'm glad this happened - because I was going to purchase the Soundsport Truly Wireless and use these as my backup - but there's no way I will ever deal with Bose's customer service again.Buy Apple airpods - buy Beat's Powerbeats3 - buy Jaybird X3's - buy Jabra Elite Sports wireless - do yourself a favor: skip Bose -- they just aren't the company they were and it's honestly just not worth the headache and hassle -"
3	:	"I have had these headphones for 1.5yrs. They sound great, they fit great, good size and good battery life.Now for the bad. They started falling apart at the 1yr mark. The casing/shell that covers the headphones and the volume switches has bubbled out and is falling off. Unfortunately this makes it very difficult to actually turn them off/on or adjust volume. I still use them because they sound good, but soon they will be uncontrollable and end up in the trash.Is there no warranty/ exchange for this kind of defective issue?"
5	:	"Love them.  Fit perfectly and extremely comfortable.  I sit in front of my computer for long periods of time and also run and workout, so I wanted a pair of wireless headphones that were comfortable but also fit in a way that would allow me to workout & run in them.  These have answered the mail AND THEN SOME!  The setup was super easy and as soon as you turn them on they connect to multiple devices IMMEDIATELY!  When running they stay securely fit in my ear, the cord lays nice behind my head (or under my chin, depending on the way you have them in), and the sound is great.  I know they do appear more bulky than some of the other options in this price point, but as a person who has done a ton of research and tested out multiple pairs I want to tell you that you will not regret going with this pair of headphones....if....you are looking for a pair of headphones that: you can wear for long periods of time, you can workout (& run) in, offers superior sound no matter what you are doing, does not completely completely get rid of ambient noises."
2	:	"I was a Bose fanboy. I love how they sound. I prefer Bose over most high-end brands. I am not saying it is better, it is just the kind of sound I happen to like. These headphones are awesome, they worked well with my iPhone and Android phones. I used them all the time for running and at the Gym. They sound great and they charge pretty fast.I am not even going to complain about the garbage clip they came with (which I lost a month after I bought them because they seemed to be designed to fall off). I've just ended up buying another clip that actually stayed on the cable for 3 bucks.The thing that takes them all the way down to 2 stars for me, is the same thing I had experience with Bose headphones (this is my 3rd pair of headphones I've own, each a different model). They start falling apart after a year. You can see in the pictures that the remote controls are exposing the internals and they are very hard to press now. Also, the power on button gets out of place, which also makes it hard to turn on/off.This is probably the last pair of Bose's headphones I'll buy, because I don't want to spend so much money (and generate more waste) each year to replace they're poor quality products. For that price, I expect to have something that last at least 5 years."
5	:	"The sound is incredible! These also have the longest range of any bluetooth device I've ever used. I'm amazed how far they will stay connected. I've used Jaybird Bluetooth earbuds for a couple years and I like them a lot, but the Bose sound better. Jaybirds stay in ear a little better while being active, but the Bose do a pretty decent job of staying in, and you don't have to compress them. They are a little bulky but manageable. For the difference in sound quality, I use the Bose now for everything. They let in some ambient sound but not as much as Bose wired earbuds. The Jaybirds block our ambient sound the best."
4	:	"The headphones are good, used them so far on two long bike rides, close to 5 hours pumping music and the battery was around 60%-65%.Sound isolation was good but I could still talk with others and stay sharp for cars coming from behind etc.The music reproduction skipped several times but after I moved my phone to the right back pocket from the jersey it got better, felt weird eating stuff from my left pocket hahahaha."
5	:	"Bose quality is second to none. These earbuds are very comfortable and being a Bose product, the sound quality is great. It comes with 3 different earbud sizes so you can get the perfect fit. It is also very easy to sync via bluetooth. I bought a pair and gave them to my son going off to college and I immediately bought another pair for myself."
3	:	"My personal opinion/experience. These headphones did not live up to my expectations. These headphones don???t have that wow factor the way Bose???s surround sound system does. The ear buds stay in my ear pretty good but after about an hour the little hook on them starts to hurt. Over all they sound good but not good enough for me to spend $150 on. I really feel like I can get the same sound quality for a pair of $75 LG earbuds. If your wondering about noise cancellation, these do not have that feature."
2	:	"These headphones were great for 7 months. Excellent sound quality for the money. However, after 7 months, the battery wouldn't charge. I went to the Bose website and followed the instructions for resetting the headphones. It took several tries, but they started working again. The battery life was hit and miss. Sometimes they charged up to 100%, but most time less than 60% after charging all night. Judging from the number of comments on the Bose website, I'm not the only one experiencing this issue.  You should purchase the extended warranty with these like I did."
1	:	"I had high hopes for this product because I wanted the heart rate monitor, liked the idea that it was more accurate and convenient than the iWatch.  That may be true in theory but the reality it it constantly missed my heart rate, just told me to insert into my ear because it was not detecting beat.  But it was already in my ear canal, what was I supposed to do, drive it into my skull?  I suppose Bose would prefer that as opposed to me returning but return I did.  Thank God for Amazon's return policy on pricey products such as this that do not deliver.  Oh and by the way, it was constantly dropping the Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 7 Plus.  What a disappointment.  Back to Amazon it goes."
5	:	"Was a gift for my husband and he really likes them!  Mostly he uses them when he is out walking with the dog. We walk 5-8 miles at a time and sometimes in traffic.  He says these wireless headphones are comfortable, stay put in his ears and have good sound quality and block out some, but not all traffic noise.  I worried the wire loop around the back of the neck might be bothersome but he doesn???t mind it at all.  Had considered getting him the Apple wireless buds since he has an iPhone and they are supposed to pair so easily but my hubby says these Bose SoundSports pair easily and the app is easy to use."
4	:	"Overall a great sound quality and long lasting battery. When I was looking for wireless headphones I was looking for some that would produce a quality sound even with quieter music, like classical instrumental music. As a classical musician, I'm always listening to softer music in loud spaces (like the train or an airplane), and these do a pretty good job of projecting the music over the ambient noise. If you are hoping to only listen to classical music, I would recommend getting some real headphones (over the ear types) as those would do a much better job of cancelling out any external noise. I went with these because I knew that I also wanted to use them when I work out, which would not have been doable with some larger over the ear wireless headphones."
3	:	I have two bose headphones and their build quality is sub par for the price they demand. The headphone charger flap came  out after a few months of use and I have to push it back in from time to time. So far I only had these for 6 months but I have a feeling they wont last too long. I will update my review after an year.
2	:	"I own three sets of Bose earphones and satisfied with all of them. Bought these for a Christmas gift to my wife. Soundwise they are Bose. Designwise they are not acceptable. She tried them and they would not stay in the ear. So, I took them over. I tried all sizes provided in the box, and not one would keep stay MY ears. And we were not moving around. In my personal experience and opinion...Very poor design. I returned them."
1	:	"Bought this item expecting a new unit, it definitely isn't. Accessory bags ripped open and ear wax on installed ear buds. Purchased directly from Amazon; wtf Amazon, this is gross.Can't speak for the quality of the headphones since I'm going to need to clean then the day I received them.What a let down..Update: turned the unit on, instantly tried syncing to ""Debbie's iPhone""..."
5	:	"They're great.Sound - 10Comfort - 10Battery life - 7 (great as a daily driver, not great for a super long trip)I'd had several others buy their pair after trying ours. I definitely recommend them."
5	:	"These are honestly, just amazing! Quality of audio is superb with incredible bass! I personally own the wired Bose In-Ear SoundSport that I got back in 2014 and those were (and still are) amazing! However, I got these for my wife and it just amazes me how much better the audio quality is compared to my own Bose earphones. Battery life is plentiful for my wife at work and they charge up pretty quickly. They also fit very nice and comfortably! Never had any issues with bluetooth cutting out or anything like that. Overall, I highly recommend these! Well worth the money!"
3	:	"So I have had these one year now and thought I would write a review about them now for those wondering if they hold up.  First off these are excellent headphones in terms of quality of sound and ease of use.  They fit comfortably in your ears and using them with your cellphone is great.My use of them has been constant but light.  I work in front of a computer and don't use them for anything other than music, games and hands free for my phone.  Again I will state the sound quality is excellent.  After one year though they are starting to come apart.  From the second I got them the rubber piece that covers the charge port didn't really fit correctly and kept popping open.  I didn't really mind because I wasn't putting them in environments that they were getting wet in so no big deal.  As the time has worn on the plastic that covers the ear bud has started separating and has come to the point of not sticking around the power button on top.  Also the little rubber pieces that sit up against the ear piece and the go around the wire, eventually slid away from the ear piece.  Given the price I was hoping they would hold together a bit better.  The above mentioned flaws do not affect the products functionality yet but they do look like they are cheap and falling apart.Pros:-Great Sound-Easy ConnectivityCons-Longevity"
3	:	"Sound quality: Great, not comparable with soundlink but as good as the previous wire version of soundsport.Fit and look: horrible. This is the first item that disappointed me from Bose. It???s bulky and heavy on the ear.Will return and look for a wireless alternative."
4	:	"Bose sound quality is great. It is really nice that when you turn it on it tells you which device it is connected to and how much battery life is left. Controls are excellent and feel solid and robust, yet light and easy to wear. Very comfortable.Unfortunately, it did not meet my needs because I was hoping for non-isolating headphones like the wired Bose IE2, and these are partially sound isolating. Another issue is I tend to have ringing ears after wearing them, even at reasonable volumes (volume that would not cause ringing with my other headphones); I have a theory that it is related to the excellent fit which is quite snug and well sealed (although quite comfortable)."
5	:	"These are hands down the most amazing pair of headphones I ever use. I always used to use my Bose AE2i's to listen to music with clarity and detail, and a cheap pair of earbuds to listen on the go. However, I found that I prefer the earbud style headphones, and used the low quality ones more. These sound incredible, are extremely comfortable (I routinely wear them for multiple hours a day), and have decent battery life. For the next generation, I would like to maybe see smaller earbuds (if they don't sound any worse) and a bigger battery. I wouldn't mind a bump like the remote control on the other side to provide more battery. Overall, I have nothing but positive things to say about this product, and I highly recommend it."
5	:	"I love these headphones and they deliver as promised. I tried cheaper wireless headphones in the past which surprisingly had great reviews - those were fraught with poor performance, sound quality, and style. These Bose wireless headphones however are of excellent build and quality. The music sounds very nice, the fit is very comfortable, the appearance of the headphones is stylish, and they remain in place during moderately vigorous workouts. I'm not a runner and I don't do CrossFit, so I can't comment on how these headphones would perform in such situations. But for everyday gym use, they are great."
2	:	"Great headphones, poor software/hardware with heart rate monitor.I???ve tried many of the solutions on the Bose support boards, and even exchanged the headphones but still cannot keep the heart rate signal once the Bose app falls out of focus (no longer active on the main screen), Apple health never sees the heart rate and no other app (like Nike+Run Club) gets the heart rate.Sure feels like a programming bug. Bose has been very nice on email and on the phone.Not with the extra money. Stick with the regular version."
2	:	"Like all Bose products I???ve owned, the sound is unsurpassed. But for the first time ever, I???ve bought a Bose product that has gradually been falling apart in me. Yes I use them a lot but not in harsh environment (I don???t wear in the sun or near water). First thing happened is rubber around control side earbud started falling off (got stretchy). Then little flaps would not stay closed and locked. Then on/off switch wouldn???t work through rubber housing (had to pull it back and use my fingernail to depress tiny switch), and last thing happened is microphone/volume rubber switch cover came off."
3	:	"I have purchased a number of earbuds, but this is the first wireless set for me.  Normally, I just buy the Comply foam tips to replace the ridiculous silicone tips that come standard with most/all buds sold today.  I have used Comply for years, and I love the Isolation tips that allow the full sound quality into the ear.  I was sold on Bose (have Bose system in my car...impressive), but skeptical about the lack of foam tip replacements for these buds.  Naturally, the factory tips were ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!  At lease 50% of the sound pressure was lost to the ambient surroundings...not what one would expect of Bose.  Frankly I am disappointed in the company for this fumble.Now for the ""However"".  The silicone tips can be folded down to expose the inner side.  I ran a small bead of silicone sealant all the way around the inside of the tip right at the seam when the buds were folded down, then let the tips fold back into their original position.  Let the sealant cure overnight, then used them just like the Comply foam tips.  The sealant forms a solid filler inside the tips in order to make a seal against the inner surface of my ears.  FANTASTIC bass and the full spectrum one would expect of Bose.  Why couldn't a company of their reputation make tips that perform like this??????"
5	:	"Excellent headphones. I'm basically married to them, use them constantly and adore them. The sound quality is incredible, the range is great, and the bulkiness is not as big of an issue as the reviewers imply. The battery life is totally reasonable and they charge incredibly quickly. I HIGHLY recommend these headphones, they're life changing. Another win for Bose."
5	:	"Absolutely love these headphones. They were delivered very quickly and are holding up amazingly over the past three months. It's like they are still brand new.  I sweat a lot and these are so easy to clean. I love that they fit securely into your ears so no matter how muchyou move they stay in place. I have small ears and these do not hurt me in any way. They are not even a little bit uncomfortable. The sound quality is awesome and the battery lasts for quite a bit. Don't usually have to charge them until about the third or fourth day, (I use them a lot mind you). Would definitely recommend these for anybody looking for headphones who lives an active lifestyle. Perfect and definitely worth the price. ????????"
5	:	"Ive owned these headphones for months now and still love them. Sticker shock is the worst part about them but the sound quality is amazing and the battery life is so much better than bluetooth headphones Ive owned in the past, not to mention the sound quality is many times better than other headphones (bluetooth or not). I like that these headphone can get very loud which comes in handy because I like to listen to music while Im on the tractor bush-hogging the yard"
4	:	"Great buds. Stay in well while running. Doesn't have the best sound quality on the microphone though. Thought for this price and brand it would have noise reduction. First time we used/tested it my kids were playing in an adjacent room and it sounded like he was in an airport terminal, they were so loud. :(Also had my order stolen(?) from the padded envelope it was shipped in somewhere in transit. Envelope arrived empty. :( Amazon was great though and sent a replacement immediately."
5	:	"Excellent sounding earbuds. The rarely cut out because of loss of Bluetooth connection. When I first got them, I took the clip off that clamps down on your shirt to hold the cord in place. I didn???t think I was going to need it. After using them every day for a month, I wish I kept the clip. When you sweat, sometimes the cord sticks to your neck and can pull on the earbud. There???s obviously a reason they included it. I wanted these over the truely wireless ones because I was afraid of losing them if they weren???t connected. The zipper case they come with is a little small, so I put them in a sun glasses case I had laying around. Definitely not a deal breaker. You don???t buy Bose for the case, you buy it for the excellent sound quality, and that???s what these deliver. The battery life is great too. I only charge them once a week and I use them every day for at least 30-60 minutes. The stay hear tips work well enough. They stay in my ears when I???m doing high intensity exercises. I would buy them again."
5	:	After reading many reviews I settled on these headphones and I???m so glad I did. I bought them to replace a set of Powerbeats headphones that I had lost recently. I was loathe to spend more money on headphones especially since my last pair was only ???ok???. But I couldn???t be happier!! I primarily use them at the gym and it was important that they sound great and not fall out while running or doing any other activity. So far I am thrilled! The ear pieces fit perfectly and the sound quality is great. Who would have thought I???d end up glad that I lost the others?
5	:	"I love these. So glad I went wireless. I've had them for one month. They are comfortable and the carrying case is convenient and hangs outside my backpack. It tells me what percentage is charged every time I turn them on. I can still hear my environment when I wear them, but I also hear my music. The connector on the back was nice to have; it connects them to my shirt so they won't fall on the ground if I take them out of my ears. However, the connector fell off and got lost."
1	:	"Sound is good, but battery life stinks!  Sometimes they only charged to 90 percent, even after two days.  Then, they would drop to 40 percent over just my 35 min drive to work.  The battery life is not good.  I used to have LG and the battery life was great, but they died every 6 mos to a year so was looking for something better that would last.  I sent the headphones back a week ago and haven't heard anything from Bose.  Thought these would be a quality product since it's Bose and they cost an area and leg."
5	:	"these sound great, fit well and stay in my ears. They also fit my wife's ears well and stay in as well. She has a really hard time finding ones that will and we've settled on the Bose design because of that alone. Built well, light enough, and the controls on the wire are easy to get to and use and really come in handy. Also, the phone audio quality is WAY better than my iPhone 6.. so , there's that too."
5	:	"Been looking for bluetooth headphones for the gym for YEARS and I decided to make the purchase and have absolutely zero regrets. Bose is well known for their high-quality products, but damn was I blown away. The packaging, the distinct high/lows, the booming bass, the lightweightness, the functionality (doesn't come out of the ears easily), and for this cheap of a price. Hands down the best investment I've made on electronics, period. Don't look any further."
5	:	"I listen to Audio books 12 or more hours a day 7 days a week and as a result the head phones are around my neck at least that long.  The good? The sound  is amazing and does an awesome job of blocking out other noise.  The not so good? They start falling apart after a few months . The logo pieces falling off, the (black) soft rubber housing around the earbuds seems to stretch  and threatens to fall off as does the soft rubber volume control cover.  I have spent much less and much more  -  these are the best quality sound for the money."
1	:	"Overall the headphones work great via bluetooth. However, I purchased these headphones for the HR functionality, and it DOES NOT work. I thought perhaps I had a defective set, and the support I received from Bose was outstanding. They even sent me a second pair. I'm having the same issue, though. If you're looking for a great set of bluetooth headphones, I recommend purchasing the cheaper model."
3	:	"I am disappointed that battery seems to need charging so quickly.  Also, I will charge it overnight or though day and it still only charges to 80%-90%.  I've never heard ""Battery 100%"".A tip re earbuds.  I am a small woman and don't think with ""large ears"".  The large is the only size that would stay in my ears.Other than that I'm happy with them so far."
5	:	"Positives:  Good sound. Stay in ears securely. The Heart Rate monitor works flawlessly and is a great bonus.Negatives: For some reasons I have lower volume in LEFT  ear.  I tried two of them the same.  It is not my ear - I have wired Bose  to compare.Also, the HR sensor creates pressure point in the ear - so after a long time it kind of hurt a little.Sound is not as good as my Bose wired in-year headphones.I wish they were smaller and had a longer battery life.In comparison to other alternatives - they a great overall"
2	:	I???ve been a Bose customer for 3 decades. They were my Go To for all speakers & headphones. No more. They???ve coasted on their good name for a long time & these unreliable & mediocre headphones are the last straw. The top of the long list of annoying quirks is that often they won???t turn on even if charged to 100%. You have to jump start them by plugging them into a charger. This renders them useless.You can get much better sound quality from bargain brands & the inside ear fit is wonky. Skip this
3	:	"So far so good. Wish the sound had a bit more range, and the volume controls aren't particularly responsive or consistent that I have seen. Sound is decent quality along with bass. These are not active noise cancelling (which I did not want) so you can still hear external noise if you wish. Battery life is good so far. Its really nice that there is no big hard plastic bulge at the back of your neck like some others. Ear fit is great for me, and three sizes of plug inserts (pairs) are included, and you can rock different sizes on each ear. Apple ear-bud type is NG for me and these fit snug without pain and don't come out accidentally."
5	:	"Throw out your Beats and get these buds.  I've had three sets of Beats earbuds and they've all broke for no reason and I'm not sure why I've been a repeat buyer.  This was the last straw and I switch to the Bose, but I was concerned by the design and how they fit.  Total surprise and amazement.  The fit is like they aren't even in your ear.  I did a jumping workout that the bose stayed in the ears without issue.  Now let's talk about the sound.  The sound is 10times better than the beats...the base is so so noticeable.  My wife then tried them and literally went onto Amazon to order them right away...note she also has Beats held together with tape.  The fact that Beats can even sell that product for over $100 when there is a product out there that is 10X better.  I'm not kidding as I will tell everyone I see to get this earbud."
5	:	"i had recently ordered a pair of POWER BEATS, they were absolute garbage. they felt cheap they had a flimsily built quality and after 1 good workout they started to malfunction. the Bose SOUNDSPORT are nothing short of fantastic so far, they look great, feel great, and work magnificently! this morning i accidentally even split a little coffee in one earbud and it continued to work flawlessly."
2	:	"This earbud definitely have good sound quality for a non noise canceling ear bud. I like the sound of it, but don???t expect to hear your music during a crowded noisy location.Battery, absolute crap. I owned it for 3 months (less than 3 months), and the batter doesn???t seem to charge up to 100% anymore. 1 month ago, it was maxed out at 90%, and now, after charging all night, it maxes out at 70%. I am expecting in a few more months, full charge is 50%. Hence, battery life sucks.Would I buy this again or recommend it?I will not. Definitely cheaper options for better product. I bought it with the idea that it is a ???Bose???, but I was wrong."
4	:	"Bose continues to provide great products.  I have been a Bose audiophile for decades and have not been disappointed yet.  These headphones received great reviews - and are deserving of them.  Easy setup, GREAT sound, quick charge. They fit nicely, and although they are not noise-cancelling they still provide great sound in an active environment, which would provide safety runners in noisy environments.  I would have given 5 stars but I have had three occasions over the numerous hours of use where there was loss of activity for a few seconds, with recovery by the system without any interaction.  Not sure what caused it since I was not moving at the time.  Higher priced than many on the market, but the Bose sound quality is what I wanted - and received."
2	:	"I love bose and own three different pairs of wired and a noise canceling set.  This is the first pair that I was truly disappointed with.  I workout and run a lot, and needed a good fitness pair of headphones.  The sound wasn't as good as bose is known for and the fit was terrible.  I tried all different size ear pieces and none fit well enough to keep the right ear piece in place due to the LARGE control box.  It's ridiculously heavy for a pair of headphones and absurdly large."
5	:	"Bought this for my mom for Christmas to allow her to roam wirelessly on conference calls and/or when she wants to dance around singing ABBA or Shania. So far she LOVES them and I think she will get a lot of use out of them in all sorts of ways.Bose truely has the BEST headphones and sound. I am a profession audio technician and I give Bose headphones an A++. I generally go towards JBL in the way of speakers, but Bose Headphones for the win!"
2	:	"I am surprised by these headphones. The charge does not last longer than a few hours. I just pulled it off of the charger about 2 hrs ago after the light was green, I went to turn them on and only 90% battery. I have not used them since taking them off the charger. This is very disappointing considering the price tag. I am not sure why these headphones suck the battery life down to nothing so quickly. They will last only half a day."
2	:	"I replaced a Plantronics which lasted almost 3 years with the Bose which I've now encountered my second failure in 3 months.  The first died within a week and I returned thru Amazon.  The second I now get to check out Bose's warranty return.  Both times the unit worked fine then after recharging would not power on.  Put it back on the charger and get nothing, no light or any status indication.  As noted the sound and battery life were good while it lasted.  Aside from that I found the cable connecting the ear pieces was overly long and at times annoying while lifting, but was fine for running.Update - Added 1 star.  Replacement through Bose was very straightforward and faster than expected.  So far so good, been about 1 month on the new set."
5	:	"I cannot fathom the negative reviews I am reading for these headphones.  I have a pair that is 1 year old this week, I use them 10+ hours a week and have never had any problems.  Sound is great, they stay in my ears while exercising in the gym or on my bike, noise canceling is moderate but I???m just trying to block the idiots talking at full volume while I???m trying to read and listen to music or watch a show in the gym or block traffic noise while listening to a book while riding my bike on the road.  Still need to know what is going on around me.  These are the only headphones I have found that do this.  Battery is still good, no parts have broken and everything still works like it did when they were new.  I did put an extended warranty on them because I have never been able to keep other brands of wireless headphones working for more than a month or two and I have had most of the big brand sets, this is my first pair of Bose Sound Sports and I am in the process of ordering a pair for my wife."
5	:	"After having a terrible experience with Powerbeats 3 I was skeptical that any bluetooth workout headphones were worth buying. I had to return my Beats 4x in 2 months and some of the reviews for the Bose Soundsport wireless sounded similar. Having had a positive experience before with Bose I gave them a shot and it has been excellent. The battery life and sound quality aren't quite as good as the Beats but they are definitely sweat proof and can easily handle a 2+ hr workout. You can skip a few days between charges too. I also noticed some comments about them staying in ears. I have never had an issue with them falling out. All in all, they've been awesome.If you're a frequent gym goer tired of wires on your headphones these are great."
2	:	"The good thing is that they dont wrap around the ear like Beats. When charging, the app does not show battery status- WHY Mr. Bose?The 1st one failed in less than a month. Just died all of a sudden during the middle of being used. Lets see how long the 2nd one will last.Wont automatically connect with iPHone during incoming call. Have to select from the screen after accepting the call. Sound is good, but these days most wireless headphones have pretty good sound. Battery not so good."
5	:	"Received my bose wireless earphone today.Cyber monday deal - 99 plus tax and One day free shipping. Can???t beat that. This is my 3rd Bose Product. This is way better than beats or other similar wireless earphones.About the earphone-Pretty good first impression. Good sound quality. Fits in my ears very comfortably. Does not fall off during workouts. Integrates very well with my iphone.My only concern would be the battery life is only 6 hours and it takes a long time to charge.But over all considering the price at which I got this, it???s a great deal."
2	:	"After just over 6 months the button controls on these headphones have begun to fall apart.  I wear the earbuds literally every day for approximately four hours each day.  After the first 3 months the volume (+) button completely depressed into the casing and shortly afterwards broke off.  At the six-month mark the power button depressed into the casing.  The sound quality is great, but I must now use my phone to increase the volume and a pen tip to poke into the casing to turn the headphones on.  The buttons and casing are not well made.  I would not buy these headphones again.Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones, Black"
5	:	"Great Bose sound as expected! Because they are bluetooth, they don't have the best battery life, but if you're only using them for workouts, they will last a week or so. I really like them.  Good fit. I got a mophie charging case for them which I would HIGHLY recommend!"
2	:	"The grey rubber started peeling off from the plastic within six months.  The power button is under (or embedded in) the grey rubber, so now they're unusable.  The little piece that clips to your shirt also broke.I'm sure if you buy a protective case for them and just use them at your desk or something they'd hold up fine (obviously this is best practice for lots of consumer electronics), but I assume you're not looking at this product if that's your intended use, because who wants fragile sport headphones that you have to treat delicately.  Apparently just normal jogging and weightlifting kills these ones.Battery life, comfort, sound quality, iPhone connectivity, all fine. But don't buy for sports or travel, they just won't hold up."
4	:	"These are a life saver.  The sound is great (really good fidelity); volume is a little lower than I'm used to, but that's probably a good thing, and they connect very easily.  I had a pair of JayBirds that i also liked, but they always had issues connecting with my devices.  These don't.  they also stay in your ears when you are working out... skiing, Mountain biking, crossfit... whatever.  they're solidCONS: they stick out of your ears a lot.... kind of like the bolts on frankenstein's monster's neck, but in your ears!  (best description I can muster.)  If you're okay with that, go ahead."
2	:	"The sound quality and the comfort are pretty good.  These stay in your ear well when working out.The practicality of these are very low.  At least for my unit1) I charge it overnight, turn them on, and it almost never passes 70-80% charge.2) It goes to zero within 1hr.3) Often I will have charged it for hours at a time, then it will say 10% charged, I plug it back in for a minute, take it out, then it says 100%4) It inconsistently pairs with a variety of devices. I use my wife's Jaybirds with the same device and they pair immediately.I unfortunately did not really use these much within the first 30 days, so cannot return these to Amazon for a refund.  I hope I can exchange these, perhaps it's a bad unit."
4	:	"Love great sound.It stick out little too much (funny looking) but as long as sound is ok, I like it.I set timer 5 minutes. However, I listen music about 10 hours a day but still have 20% battery.I give 4 stars because I can not hear my voice when I call.It has microphone already. Why in the world they not make I can hear when I talk on the phone.Feel like, I can hear some other side of phone but I need to guess what I talk.Feel this way, because it block my ears.It fit tight but easy to come out when I move a lot.Regardless, all this complain I can still give 4 stars because of battery life and great sound."
5	:	"I've always been a huge fan of Bose products as I feel they have superior sound quality for the best price and they have done it again. I highly anticipated getting these for my husband who absolutely loves them. He uses them while working out, biking, helping with the baby, cleaning...work calls also! I told him he has to get me a pair because they are so cool! Great if you have a kid and go for walks. The sound is awesome, feels like you're surrounded by music. Love love love them."
5	:	"Really love these. I got them to use with my Apple watch for running.  It's really great to be untethered from wires and the sound is amazing for how small they are--very rich, deep and what you'd expect from anything made by Bose.  They kind of feel like they're going to fall out a lot, but it's just a feeling, they're really pretty snug fitting and I've never had one fall out."
4	:	"I really like these headphones. They have great sound quality, are comfortable and indeed to stay in place while you're moving about. Cons: First - battery life is only around 3 hours, so don't forget to bring the charger. Second - in windy conditions, the sound of the wind rushing over the ear bud drowns out whatever I'm listening to. I'm guessing this is because most of the headset sticks so far outside the ear. Recommended if you are not a speed runner or would be using where it's very windy."
5	:	"Compact and fit perfectly with the matching charging travel case. The battery lasts a long time-flew across the country on a crowded plane with an excessive talker across the aisle-perfectly peaceful trip with these headphones to watch a movie and enjoy music. At the end of the flight, still had 90% battery per the headphones. Works great!"
5	:	"Before buying these headphones I bought 3 cheap ones, so they did have a thousands almost 5 star reviews, the sound was not great, the fit was uncomfortable, one had a constant high frequency buzz, making them completely unusable.  I gave up, and bought Bose.. and they are wonderful, very comfortable, sound is amazing, the battery last forever.  Should not have wasted money, and bought Bose in the first place."
5	:	"I use earbuds for my workouts at the gym 5 days a week.  My old pair finally died a while back and I decided to upgrade.  I tried two different wireless (no wire connecting the buds) including the new Jabra Active Elite and was massively disappointed.  The buds wouldn't connect to each other, the sound was not great (for $130...) and they were not comfortable.  I decided to go back to wired (earbuds connected together) with Bluetooth.  Tried these new Bose SoundSport.  AWESOME.  The buds fit in the ear perfectly and no matter what activity I do they don't budge and they're actually comfortable.  The sound is EXCELLENT - what you would expect from Bose - full bass, sharp highs and no distortion.  The optional charging case is nice as well as you can bump up the battery level while storing them in your bag, etc.  I use them for about an hour a day and they lasted the full 5 days without a recharge, but probably wouldn't go much more.  Would totally buy these again."
5	:	"I use these pretty much every day.  Love them!!! Only thing was I broke the clip to attach to your shirt.  Found replacements on amazon of course. I use while walking the dogs, running, biking and at work. I only use one earbud though so I can hear what???s going on around me.  I prefer them on a phone call too instead of talking into the phone.  Very clear.  I think you can hear better."
4	:	"I absolutely love these and wonder how I ever lived without them!  Whenever I used to use headphones with a cord, I would always get so frustrated because I would pull them out accidently.I do have to say that the ear piece is a little difficult to put in when you first try these.  I am getting better at getting them in.  They are definitely comfortable - they do not hurt your ears during extended wear like the apple ear buds do."
5	:	"I'll keep it short and simple.Pros :1. Amazing lows (bass and sub-bass). Don't compare it with beats since beats always overwork the bass and make it more thumping, giving it an artificial touch.2. Mids amd highs are comparably good if not the best. Enough for an earphone.3. Though bully, fit and comfort are amazing. Never falls down no matter how much you jump and run.4. Build quality is good. Feels premium. (Except one thing that I'll mention in the Cons below)Overall sound and comfort, both are amazing. It's Bose. And it does enough or more to maintain the name.Cons :1. Inline controller is a waste. The rubber comes off. Do not use tht too much to control music or the volume. I mean how did it even pass the design phase?!2. Overall volume is just a little bit, like 2 steps low. So to get that extra push and the kick, you need to raise it by 1-2 steps higher than you normally need to do on an earphone. Manageable.3. Battery. 6 hours. That is low. It doesn't affect me that much though. Depends on usage. For me, I hear about a couple of hours each day and hence it lasts for 2 days easy, on one charge.Overall, except a couple of cons that can be overlooked, this is an earphone, which you need to own.Trust me you won't regret the 149$ you'll spend on it, it's that good."
4	:	"These headphones are amazing. I love Bose headphones. This was my second pair of Bose.The Good:The sound is unmatched. You get great, deep bass from these little in-ear buds. They are very convenient by being wireless and sync effortlessly via Bluetooth. They are great for commuting or working out. I left my phone in my locker at the gym and played basketball with these and was probably 30-60 feet away from my phone and I experienced no issues with playback. These headphones allow you to make and take calls, which is very convenient. A computerized voice will tell you how much battery life you have remaining upon turning on the device or if the device got to about 20% life.The Not-So-Good:This is likely a personal preference, but I found the joint cord to be a bit annoying. Sometimes it would flop to one side or the other. Rarely, the sound would also cut out for a split second, though it never really bothered me too much. The phones did not seem to hold a charge as long as I expected. After 2 hours at the gym, I would go from 100% charge to about 30%. Perhaps distance from the phone affects battery life?Overall, I highly recommend these. The only real reason why I left 4 stars is because I want to upgrade to the completely wireless Bose SoundSport phones and not deal with a connecting cord at all. Great product, Bose!!!"
5	:	I primarily use my ear buds at the gym. They fit my ears good and stay in while running on the treadmill. The sound is great and the volume is loud enough considering that the music is very clear. The only thing I don't like is the power button. You have to hold it really long to get them to power on. Battery life is decent but not great. 4-5 hours. Overall great wireless ear buds.
3	:	"Spendy, Jaybird does it just as well if not better for cheaper. Only thing these guys have is that patent on the earbuds for comfort, and I'm sick of forging old bose earbuds to fit the jaybirds.Don't use these in wind. Jaybird has no wind sound. On a bike going 10mpg the sound is overwhelmed and there is nothing I can do short of 3d printing an aerodynamic cover for the black bits sticking out like an alien. This is my, like, real gripe with em."
5	:	"Gosh, these look bulky! That was my first reaction on seeing these and I had almost made up my mind to return them. Thankfully I held on for one more day and tried them out. The sound quality from Bose SoundSport wireless is incredible. I generally am a fan of the 'Bose sound' and these are packed full of it. You get the sense that they really wanted to get the sound right, even if it meant compromising on the looks. After listening to them, they seem more like miniaturized version of over-ear head sets and less like oversized earbuds.Am also happy to report these are quite comfortable to wear for a good length of time."
4	:	"My main problem with these is the volume does not turn up as loud as I???d like it to. Also these things are WIDE. Might as well get actual headphones. They look funny when in your ears. 3 stars because they are comfortable, sound decent, and made well. I also like the clip in the back and the bose app.UPDATE: I found a fix to the volume too low problem. On iPhone go to settings, music, and make sure the EQ, volume limit and sound check are all off. Made a heck of a difference. Volume is as loud as I can take! Only reason I didn???t give 5 stars is how far they stick out"
4	:	"Pros - good sound quality; fit very well and they do not fall out when I exercise, running, weight lifting, HIIT training, jumping and sprinting, etc.; water proof, they handle sweat really well, long wearing hours (4-5 hours no problem when fully charged). Cons - the sound volume is little low and you have to increase volume often. If you listen to classical music a lot and like to hear more details in the music, these headphones are not your best choice. Overall, I use them mainly for sports and they work great for that!"
5	:	I have been a Bose owner of headphones for nine or so years. I started with the wired about three sets and now I am using the SoundSport!! These bad boys are awesome. The fact that they are wireless they can connect with multiple devices i.e. my IPhone and my laptop at the same time. When I get a call the headphones adjust so I can answer while I am talking the laptop stands by until my phone call is done. Then it will pick up the movie from the laptop again and I am all good. I suggest anyone who wants wireless to try these out. Of course the quality is unsurpassed since it is Bose.
2	:	"Pairing the headphones with iPhone using the Bose app is easy, and the sound is great. Volume is a little lower than expected but does not diminish sound quality. I have had repeated issues with the headphones related to firmware updates. During use, playback stops and a repeated tone is heard through the headphones. Bose iPhone app indicated it is transferring a firmware update which seems to take hours or even days :). During this time, the headphones drop Bluetooth connection or continue to play the repeated tone. Replacement process with Bose takes 2-4 weeks :(."
2	:	"Great sound quality when they work! Both earbuds would suddenly go static and I will no longer be able to hear anything beside a high pitch whistle. The headphones won't even turn off for few minutes before they switch off on their own few minutes later.Update:Bose exchanged them for me with the same color, and it was the same problem again, so I returned them. Then I went to a Bose store and got the same color, the store told me it might've been a bad batch on Amazon, anyway now a little over a month later, they're workimg perfectly. I think all the gray ones are defective, I got a black pair from Amazon before and I had no problem at all."
3	:	"Positives:Pairs well with my phone iPhone.Microphone is exceptional as I've tested it with several friends/family and they all say voice is coming through very clear.Call sound comes through both ears (something I understand is not possible with the new wireless ones?)Negatives:Ear buds are not comfortable due to the extra rubber around the edge. I guess this is because they were meant for running and they wanted a dryer and/or tighter fit. However, I really miss my old wired SoundSport phones. Those never fell out and were much more comfortable.Because of the extra gasket on the earbud, you can't hear yourself talk which take some getting used to (hopefully).The wire in back gets caught on collars if you are wearing a work shirt or poloOverall earpiece just feels bulky.Sadly, I think I am going ot have to spring for the old wired set and keep these in reserve. I may try the truly wireless ones at some point or Apple earbuds."
1	:	I am a person whom refrains from writing bad reviews unless it is clearly justified.This product was purchased by myself as to upgrade the many existing earbuds that have been used consistently every day.It was suggested by a friend to go the Bose route as top of the line head bud.These headphones not only sound inferior and are overly overpriced considerably to the many other buds available .My suggestion is to try one of the other headphones available on Amazon at one third the price.
5	:	"Very impressed. I love Bose products and wasn???t hesitant about buying these. I didn???t buy them for working out, just travel, and they are great. Sound is perfect and stay in my ears. The ONLY thing I would like even more is if the cord between the buds was longer. Felt a little short to me and makes the volume access awkward so high up by my right ear. Also I have long hair so I like the clip in the back so I can hook it to my necklace or shirt to stop it from falling out when I move/flip my hair."
1	:	"I think the sound on these headphones is a 5/10 compared to my wired Soundsport at 8/10. If you have to compromise that much on sound quality, it's definitely not worth going wireless. The comfort was fine. You look like Frankenstein because they stick out so much, but it didn't bother me that much. Really disappointed with the sound quality, so I returned them."
4	:	"These are the most comfortable earbuds that fit in my ears - the silicone bud cover and hook is very soft. Comes with a clip to clip on your clothes. Nice carrying case with a snap carabiner. Sound is good quality for both music and podcasts, though not the best for its price. Bluetooth connection is maybe 15 to 20 yards. Shorter playtime (6 hours) compared to some other earbuds, but comfort for long wear time was my main concern. The earbud profile sticks out of your ears so it's a little trickier using them lying in a bed or couch."
4	:	"Sound is good, to be a bose, honestly could be better.. takes a while to get used to, they stay put good so far.. haven???t taken them for a spin, but willUpdate how they hold under sweat. I Like the interaction with the phone and app for control."
5	:	"I spent a few weeks looking over wireless earbuds wishing the internet would give me a definitive answer and then I took the plunge. I own a Bose Soundlink Mini II and a set of Bose bookshelf speakers so I figured the sound quality would be just as tight as those. They arrived in perfect sleek packaging and away I went. The earbuds are extremely comfortable and with a twist, they lock comfortably into your ears. The sound is fantastic but I wish they were a little louder and lower levels of volume. That's my only complaint. It's always a good idea to break-in your headphones so I recommend not going full volume right out of the box. Give it some time. :-)In closing, these are definitely worth the money."
1	:	"I own other Bose products that are wonderful and, in general, believe their reputation for quality is deserved.  These earbuds, on the other hand, are horribleBose SoundSport Wireless Headphones, Citron.  While they are attractive and comfortable to wear with a nice fit, the sound quality for the costs is not terribly great.  I had previously used an inexpensive Boozon wireless that was a fraction of the price and had far superior sound with long battery life.  The Bose battery lasts about two hours.  The cables on the Boze are heavy duty, and I like that, however, the rubber encasements around the buds are loose, and the one around the controls is almost ready to fall off.  Speaking of the control buttons, they are difficult to use and very unresponsive.  Tiring of the difficulty I was experiencing with hearing phone conversations due to the Bluetooth clicking and blipping all the time I finally gave up and looked for another $20 Boozon and unfortunately could not locate on Amazon.  I opted for the Bluesim EJ007 for about an 8th of the price, and immediately I am much happier with the quality, sound, and ease of use.  I cannot recommend the Bose, in fact, I suggest that you NOT purchase them.  I still believe the company produces great products but these, like their color, are lemons."
5	:	These are the best sounding wireless headphones that I have ever owned.. I use them when I go to the gym and when hiking and they stay put in my ears. You just have to make sure that you put the right fitting ear rubber mounts on the headphones. It comes with three different sizes . They are a little bit bulky and stick out of the ears more than other wireless headphones that I have owned but once you put them on and use them you don't even notice the difference. I would definitely purchase these again and Bose sound is amazing.
5	:	"Does not disappoint! I have always been a huge fan of Bose products, and these headphones are definitely worthy of their name! The sound is excellent, there are 3 different ear pieces to choose from for the right fit. The ones I chose fit my ears perfectly! No more falling out or sound loss, due to not fitting. They tell you when you turn them on how much battery power is left and what they are connecting to. An added bonus, you can connect them to your iPhone and iPad at the same time. I can watch a movie on my iPad and if my phone rings, it will pause the movie on my iPad and allow me to answer the phone call. They are definitely worth the money and as far as I am concerned Bose again has exceeded my expectations."
3	:	"I don't typically write product reviews, but my disdain for these headphones necessitates the communication. For some background, I recently bought a new iPhone which has required me to buy a dongle or buy a new pair of headphones. After a lot of research, I ended up going with the Creative Outlier One. They're nothing fancy, but for ~$30 they have decent sound, great battery life, and remove a lot of environmental noise. I didn't run into any issues with Creative's product, but decided to try the Bose SoundSport since they were on sale for Black Friday ($99). To provide a brief comparison between the two, the Bose sound wasn't any better (if not worse), battery life was less, and I could hear significantly more environmental noise (which is a deal-breaker for me). So the significantly more expensive pair (Bose) are going back and I'm sticking with my Creative's for now."
2	:	"Purchased 1/24/173/9/18: The sound quality is what you would expect from Bose. They are very comfortable and cancel outside noise quite well. I???ve had these for over a year & use them about 20 hours per week at work or the poker table. After about 6-8 months, the control button began to malfunction & the rubber is coming off. Other rubber parts on the earbuds themselves are coming loose as well. All in all, I???m satisfied with them, & they still work fine, except the control buttons. I just didn???t expect them to start falling apart as early as they did.Update 10/19/18: ALL the rubber components have come off now. The volume button is completely useless & I have to dig my fingernail into the space where the on/off button is to find the switch to turn them on/off. These are definitely not made to last, as they haven???t even lasted 2 years. I have reservations about purchasing again from Bose."
5	:	"Sound quality is good, battery is anywhere about 4hrs of continous us. The best part is the warranty and service that Bose offers. My unit started losing its charge after 6 months of good hard use (Gym, work, biking, hiking, yard work). Called Blse support, they had me ship my old unit free of charge abd they shipped me a new unit! The best oart is my warranty started all over again!! Awesome!!"
4	:	"Solid sound quality, battery only last for about 4.5 hours of continuous use. I've had this for about 8 months now and with continous daily use including exercise, I've found that the plastic case is finally starting to lose it's adhesiveness...I've also found that it moves in the ear alot when excessive movement like running or doing CrossFit...that's because of the perspiration caused by the exercise...also tricky to wear a hoodie with this because the unit protrudes from the ear"
1	:	"I had a pair of the wired SoundSport headphones and loved them, so I bought these thinking they would be the same but better. Wrong. The battery life is atrocious - at this point it's only been 10 months and even after a full night's charge when I turn them on the nice lady tells me they're 80% charged. Eighty percent! After charging all night!! I wear my headphones to commute and to exercise, and I can't get through a day of running followed by commuting to and from work - a total of maybe 3 hours - without these dying. They're also bulky on my ears and bounce around a little. After a few months I gave up on them and went back to the wired pair - I missed the deadline to return these, sadly, so learn from my mistake and wait for a better pair of wireless earbuds to come along. Or check out the Apple ones, I hear people love them.Things they have going for them: sound is ok (the wired version is better), they connect to my iPhone seamlessly."
5	:	"I'm one of those people who cannot wear any in-ear earbuds because they ALWAYS fall out. Apple ear buds, Yurbuds, you name it, all falls out. I climb every other day and I'm a very active person so over the ear headphones is not an option b/c they're too big and gets my ears hot. These are the BEST ear buds I've ever owned, they stay in while running, climbing, etc. The sounds quality is great and also it charges really fast. I can typically get it from 0 to 100% charged in 30 mins. If you're like me and no in-ear earbuds have ever worked for you, then this is the product for you!"
3	:	"good quality and built. sound is good, but low volume.I usually wear headphones on the train commuting to / from work. These aren't able to drown out the loud train tracks. barely can hear the movie. i have had to switch to my wired headphones every time i would go to any loud environment.upon my my personal comparisonsI have found 100% volume on these headphones = roughly 60% volume on wire headphones."
5	:	"My Soundsport Wireless earbuds are excellent. The sound quality is outstanding ??? I can hardly believe they are ???ear buds,??? not full headphones. They are very comfortable, stay securely in place and have good battery life. My only critique is that the controls have almost no tactile feedback???important since you can???t see the buttons while wearing them. I like tech gadgetry, so when I first powered on the device and launched the phone app and it began downloading a firmware update, I was like ???Alriiiight!??? I tried a cheaper brand but sent them back; glad I wound up with Bose!"
5	:	I'm very happy with my Bose earbuds. The fit is perfect and they never fall out of my ears even when bouncing around on the mower. They are very light and comfortable.  The sound quality is amazing. I have a wired pair of Klipsch that I thought were the best until I purchased these. The battery last a long time and they are easy to charge. I use the carry case all the time and it is holding up nicely. The only complaint I have is that I wish I could turn them up louder. I wear them in the mower all the time and need more volume. This seems to be the case with all Bluetooth headphones I've had. The wired ones are much louder. I would recommend these to everyone because overall I love them. I hope they last.
5	:	"I needed earbuds that would stay in my ears and provide crystal clear communication.I bought them to talk on my iPhone.I fell in love with them the first time a played music.I work outdoors and so far they've proven tough enough to be jerked out of my ears, stepped on, rained on, and left on the dashboard on a 110?? day."
1	:	"I bought these late February 2018 and they died today. I am horrified that such expensive earbuds didn???t make it a year. I used these for my run (30 mins or less) every morning and occasional use listening to music and podcasts during the day. They were good when they worked but 9 months is not a reasonable lifespan for this price point. Mine started buzzing and that was it, I couldn???t even power them off. Definitely do not recommend."
1	:	"I have a lot of respect for the Bose company (and the company this year received a major IEEE award). I also have several of their products. However, this particular earphone has been very disappointing. While the sound quality is the usual Bose quality, the battery life is awful. And I mean AWFUL. Either my unit is defective (but I took it to store and they asked me to update the firmware!) or it is not really capable of handling more than 2-3 hours of talk. Moreover, I don't seem to be able to fully charge it even after leaving it connected to the wall charger for a full day. It typically charges only up to 70-80%. I have had this for only 2 months. Would return if I could."
5	:	"I've been purchasing LG Tones for years and every so often deviate --- for maybe a week or two to try a different bluetooth earbud headphone --- but always end up buying another LG Tone. Until now...The Bose SoundSports are great! They are incredibly comfortable --- which is the primary reason I have been looking for something new. In addition to music (as expected, better than LG Tones), I can easily hear podcasts (remarkably clearer and louder than LG Tones) and phone calls (as well as LG Tones). Most importantly, what I'm NOT hearing is complaints from whomever I'm talking to. Other than when using LG Tones, that is a first!"
5	:	"Almost seems redundant to other reviews, but I have to report these are great headphones. Gave a set to both my wife (whose age will not be reported) and my twenty-five year old son for Christmas. They both loved them. I don't think my son has ever heard sound that good out of headphones. They also stay firmly attached to their ears when they are using them. Highly recommended!"
1	:	"What I like- the product is compact and comfortable to wear. The option to connect calls on the headset is great as well.What I dislike- I am on my second pair after the last set was finally lost in travel. I purchased a new set Mar 2018- I started having problems in May 2018. The headset would not charge fully, the connection would remain strong but the ear buds would momentarily pause the sound and the wire started to wear away. I use these for work conference calls and participants voices would slow motion like an old cassette tape.Fortunately the manufacturer is to provide a replacement. I also purchased the third party insurance- which I would not recommend. It was a lesson to me that Bose will not acknowledge any insurance purchased through Amazon.A special note: working with the Bose support team is not a piece of cake, these poor people are like robots with a poor phone system. I went as far to speak to a manager on the team to voice my concerns on quality of product and how it does not justified a $35 markup from my original purchase a year ago- be prepared for a backhanded compliment for your continued loyalty to allow them to disregard any feedback you may have. No joke."
3	:	"I???m a huge fan of Bose and wanted these headphones for a long time, unfortunately they didn???t work out for me. First, they wouldn???t stay in my ears regardless of the insert size I tried. They stick out quite far which adds weight and caused them to fall out regularly. Also, I couldn???t figure out the best way to deal with the cord as someone with long hair. Under/over the hair, nothing felt right. Not an issue for men/short-haired people I suppose."
1	:	"Would put 5 stars but I'm extremely disappointed! , have had bose for years never had an issue with several of their products I have purchased until now , I've barely had these earphones a few months and all of a sudden they aren't working well only one side works and u can barely hear the sound and other side is even lower !. Haven't dropped or stepped on them nothing , I barely use them and hour a day at most !"
5	:	"I have never been a fan of using headphones while I lift weights, but these looked like they wouldn't get in my way, so I thought I'd give them a try.  I used them once and was hooked!  The Bose sound is great and they're so comfortable!!  You might have to watch them if you're exercising laying down, but it's just a quick check to make sure you aren't laying on the wire... but seriously, not a big deal.  Overall, I am happy with everything about them and am very happy with my purchase!!"
5	:	"I have wasted a lot of money buying so many ear plugs to find them shorting out in a few months , reason is I am a runner and I sweat a lot running and also working out in the gym,I tried Beats and it took only a few months before they shorted out, these Bose ear plugs are the best for people who sweat a lot ,quality of sound is also very good and if you are a person who sweats like crazy running or working out ...this is the best money can buy , forget the rest !"
5	:	"I have recently purchased myself a pair of Bose Soundsport Wireless Headphones and am nothing less than impressed. For individuals that enjoy athletic activities such as: going to the gym, golfing, or going for a run, the Soundsport Headphones are a great accessory to all of these activities.One problem someone may come across when working out is that their headphones may fall out when doing certain exercises, but not with the Soundsport Headphones from Bose. The shape of the headphone is well contoured to the shape of your ear and the headphones have been proven to not fall out during physical activities. To fight the chances of the headphone falling out even more the Soundsport Headphones are equipped with a shirt clip that offers even more protection to falling out of your ear.The Bose Soundsport Wireless headphones have the redeeming quality of excellent bluetooth connectivity. This is a great feature for activities such as a leisure game of golf or if you are in a smaller home gym. The reason this is so great is that you are able to leave your phone or primary music device either on a counter in a gym or in your golfbag and still listen to your music with no problems. There is a range where the wireless headphones will not connect to the individual's music device, which is a fact true for any bluetooth device.The Bose Soundsport Wireless Headphones give you great control over your music without needing your phone or primary music listening device. Connected to the wire that connects your two earbuds together is a control center for your music listening needs. The control center offers the listener the ability to control the volume of the song as well as move through tracks on your designated playlist. The control center also acts as a receiver if you were to get a phone call while wearing your Soundsport Headphones.As a shopper for wireless headphones it would be of your utmost interest to make the investment into the Soundsport Wireless Headphones from Bose."
5	:	"The headphones fit well into the ear, the sound quality is great, and the battery life is more than decent (although here I don't have anything to compare with). The carrying case is convenient and nice looking, and it clips conveniently to my bag. I'm somewhat less happy with the little clip that is supposed to connect to a shirt to prevent the wire from moving to one side (and it does, once the clip is gone). The clip is prone to falling off, and will inevitably get lost. They need to invest some more thought into this. The other issue is that sometimes the sound gets garbled when the phone is in my pocket - but perhaps the issue is with the phone rather than with the headphones, I'm not sure (as I said, most of the time the quality of the sounds is great)."
2	:	"The sound quality is just okay. After about 6-8 months of having this, I started having issue with charging the earphone. Most of the time, I had to hold the earphone to the cable to get it charged otherwise nothing. I sent it back and they sent a new one, the new one had a problem with its button, so I sent that back, they sent another one, the other one lost connection in the middle of a phone call despite of the phone being on my pants pocket.They offered an upgrade Soundsport Pulse, which I took but this earphone also had charging issue, so I sent it back. They're sending me another Soundsport Pulse.To conclude the product is terrible but their customer service is acceptable, despite ""forgetting"" to send the third replacement thus adding another 2 weeks to my wait time. Please do not buy this product if you want to be in a constant correspondence with Bose technical support. This is my first Bose product so I'm starting to doubt the quality of their product in general since they sent me two types of products and all of them have issues."
5	:	"These are exceptional earphones.  The sound is amazing.  I originally purchased the jaybird freedoms, and my ears were aching after several minutes. The fit just wasn't right. Returned them right away and ordered these. The sound difference is quite an amazing jump. This has a way more full sound and bass.  (The others were suboptimal.) I'm glad I made the choice for Bose instead. The fit is just right."
5	:	"I rarely write product reviews, but these headphones are well worth the effort.I got them a few days ago and used them a couple of times already. The sound quality and in-ear fit is the best I ever had. It produces an unusually warm and deep sound compared to my previous in-ear bluetooth headphones in the same and even higher price range (see below).  My use of bluetooth headphones is almost exclusively in the gym, where I???m listening mostly to trance and house music on them, though I???ve also tested classical music on these with great results. What really blew my mind was the deep and powerful bass this little beast can produce, way beyond any other in-ear headphone I ever owned. It actually sounds as good as a high quality over-ear headphone. The volume is on the higher end, enough to block out external noises such as the annoying low-quality pop sound track playing in the fitness center. Bluetooth and management seem to work well so far, no issues with multiple devices.I have previously owned for the same use -Jaybird Bluebuds X Bluetooth ($130) for about a year - it got to very high volumes, but the sounds were shallow, flat bass and the in ear fit was horrible.Bang and Olufsen (B&O) Beoplay H5 ($250) for another year - The biggest disappointment and worst investment I ever made, weak volume, short battery life, flat bass and the dumbest bluetooth device management. In ear fit was mediocre.The Bose SoundSport is absolutely the best bluetooth in-ear sport headphones in the $100-250 range I owned, highly recommended.(this review is not sponsored by Bose in any way)"
1	:	"I bought my headphones Bose in January this year and 7 months of use have stopped working. They do not take charge, turn on the green light immediately as if it were charged and then simply do not turn on. It has been a total failure being an expensive product."
5	:	"They sound great and are very comfortable in my ears. The on-off is immediate, it tells you the battery %, and if already connected by bluetooth. I use them for about 1 hour per day and that uses upwards to 10% of the battery. Thus I recharge them about every 10 days which is not bad. I also like the litle alligator clip which you can use to clip the wire onto your collar at the back of your neck. Even though they have never fallen out of my ears I like the extra security."
5	:	"These headphones are amazing. I've bought numerous pairs of bluetooth wireless headphones. Amazon seems to always have a decent cheap pair for $20 or $30 as a deal that I've always stuck to but they just don't sound that great. I decided to bite the bullet and spend the extra money on Bose for the ""Sound Excellence"". And man I'm glad I did! These sound amazing. All acoustics are in range. A lot of bass, great mid-range, and just enough treble. Perfect set of wireless headphones."
1	:	"On the first use of these headphones the volume clearly doesn't work. First, the product made several loud beeps and then proceeded to operate at high volume with the control not functioning. I tried turning them off, back on, charging them, etc to no avail. Terrible product, defective from the offset."
2	:	"I got them a couple of months ago. Sound-quality wise, they are great. I love the bass and the high quality we expect from Bose. That being said, all other aspects of these headphones are awful. All the rubber is falling apart. I've tried to glue them back together but not even that is working anymore. This is something I would expect for a cheap knock-offs, not something from Bose. In addition to that, a lot of times the sync fails or the headphones fails to play (even after it's sync'ed). Finally, something that happens all the time is fail to charge. That should be so simple, right? You plug in to a USB port and it starts to charge, right? What happens, though, is that very frequently you put it to charge, wait several hours, and after the green light is on it is still not charged - like nothing has happened. This is not a battery issue, as sometimes it works properly. Overall, I would not recommend this product."
3	:	"Overall, these headphones get the job done and are satisfactory. That said, as others have stated, there are a few things that they got wrong that much cheaper competitors got right making this a poor choice. I have had 3 sets of wireless headphones recently including this pair. My favorite ones (Q22 sound peats) were a quarter of the price of these. I will admit, the Bose had the best sound quality but that was the only win for Bose. The headphones are clunky and feel awkward. These were supposedly designed for running but they fall out of my ear if I run any faster than about an 8:30 mile pace which is barely running for me (I consider 9min+ miles a jog for me). The off/on button was hard to press. It's hard to switch tracks while running (I had a pair from another brand that had dedicated skip buttons making it easy). And lastly, MY BIGGEST GRIPE... Why is the volume so f'n low on these? It sounded 25-30% lower volume than its competitors. I also didn't like that people around me could hear the music as well since it doesn't seal to your ear orifice. I couldn't justify owning these and the sound peats so I returned these."
1	:	"I was so hoping that these would work great but not so.  I own a Bose portable speaker and have loved it for years without a single problem.  So it was natural that I believed that these would work great.  The first pair died after one month.  I called Bose and got a free replacement.  The replacement died after two uses!  The only thing I can think of is the sweat.  I ran for 30 mins and they died as I was stretching.  Buyer Beware!!!  After purchasing it from Amazon, you can not get a refund, only replacements!  I ordered a Bose sport headphones WITH a wire hoping these last"
5	:	"Despite my narrow ear canals, these stay in my ears perfectly while I am jogging outside and they work flawlessly with the bluetooth music on my watch. The receiver is on the right, so I have to switch my watch to my right side when I'm outside to avoid drops in reception. They look weird sticking out so far from my ears, but I refrain from looking in the mirror, and they are just what I needed."
4	:	I love these ear buds. Only problem is they turn off after about an hour. Otherwise the sound is great.
2	:	"I'm a little disappointed.  After my PowerBeats died (approx 2-3 yrs) I ordered these Bose SoundSport since I love my Bose over ear noise cancelling headphones.  However, these SoundSport headphones lack the sound quality of the over ear model.  I expected some of that, of course, since they are Bluetooth, but the PowerBeats sounded the same or a little better and were more comfortable to wear (also more secure with the over ear piece).  I'm returning these and re-ordering the PowerBeats (this time with a 4 year protection plan!)"
5	:	"I was talked into buying a pair of Beats wireless headphones...the quality didn???t even come close to these Bose. The sound quality is Bose is absolutely beautiful!  As someone who has studied music extensively, these are the only pair of headphones to listen to music with. I hear instruments with these that I didn???t even realize were there. These make me want to listen to music all day!"
1	:	"As a student with a limited budget, I got these headphones. The price is very high, but using other bose products, I thought these headphones would last long. However, I am very disappointed because the quality is not good. The case provided for these headphones is not protective at all (please see the picture).I am definitely so sad because  I cannot afford another pair, so I basically wasted my money :(Please reconsider, if you really want to buy these headphones from amazon..."
5	:	"Good battery life as advertised. Probably lasts me 3-4 workouts. These are NO noise cancelling, which I like; they do not completely seal your ear canal so you can still hear around them. Good range; I can leave my phone in my gym locker and shuffle through my playlist with just the built-in button. Nice design. Only con is I wish they felt more secure, the small clip that allows it to attach to you shirt is easily lost and can come off with light handling. the clip is important in keeping them from bouncing or pulling out of your ears but you can definitely get by without it."
4	:	"I have used these headphones for a few days out walking.  The sound is great and the headphones are easy to use.  However, I gave 4 stars because the ear pieces aren???t as comfortable as I would want.  I just switched from the medium to small ear pieces and hope that will help.  I did see one review where the person said they got a message needing wi fi to play music from phone.  I got that message too and found I had to download all my music onto my phone, which was easy but took some time.  Once I did that everything was fine."
4	:	"Only knocking 1 star off right now for changing the style of the ear piece. I loved the Bose SoudSport in-ear headphones for Samsung & Android that I purchased last year. They came with 3 different sized rubber ear pieces but I didn't have to try the L or S. The mediums worked great.Now Bose made BT so I decided to go wireless. I can't comment on the battery life or how it really sounds with a phone call. But I can review the connecting to devices, comfort, and sound listening to music.Connecting to my Samsung Galaxy s7 was simple once you download the Bose Connect app.Music is pretty much all treble or highs. No bass or lows can be heard at all to me but that is expected with headphones.Biggest gripe is the comfort. Bose changed the style of the ear pieces. I used the medium (M) sized piece that were already on them. They stayed in my ear perfectly but after maybe 20-30 mins of listening to music, my ears were bothering me. I had my wired Bose headphones with me so I decided to see if those ear pieces would fit on the BT before I tried the S or L sized that came with them.As you can see in the pictures attached, the white ear pieces from the wired set fit just fine on the BT. I then put the S black ear pieces on my wired headphones but noticed that the S is a little loose in my ears compared to the M sized pieces.I may update later with further review but these will never get 5 stars b/c the style of the ear pieces were changed. Hopefully I won't have to subtract any stars either."
5	:	the sound is excellent.  the buds fit in my ears comfortably. the cord is strong.  the attachment from the cord to your shirt collar was lost in the first week but doesn't really affect the use.  the cord kinda comfortably sits around your neck and doesn't really go anywhere else. the charge lasts long and the app is good too.  this honestly is the best electronic purchase I've made all year (2016)
3	:	"This is honestly the first time I have not loved a Bose product. The two hour battery time, and bluetooth features are great for exercising. In that regard this product shines, that is exactly what they were designed for. However, Im ready to throw these in the trash. The longer i use these, the more frequently they drop offline. After about 30 minutes of solid use, they will lose the connection with my phone roughly once every 3 minutes. So far the only way to avoid this loss of connection is to turn the earphones off, then back on. This will give roughly 15 minutes of uninterrupted play before the disconnections resume. Even after performing the update that the companion app had for me has done nothing to fix the reliability of these earphones. I know I'm not the most tech savvy person, and my style is a little old school, but the day i have to troubleshoot earphones and perform updates is the day that the utility is surpassed by the annoyance factor. I couldn't honestly recommend these to a friend, or even a stranger. Save your money, and look for alternatives."
2	:	"I bought these as a gift for myself for my birthday.  I have only used them a handful of times.  I fully charged them last night and by the time I walked to my gym around the corner, it was already at 80%.  When I got out from the gym an hour later, it was already at 30%.  I just recharged them so they should have been at 100%, but again, they were at 80% to start.  I've only had them for four months and I'm so disappointed because the sound quality is excellent, but I'd expect them to last longer for the price I paid."
5	:	"I've tried too many headphones to remember them all, in the past all wired, and the last few years all BT. These are the best BT headphones I've used, ever. The connection is bullet-proof, and never drops. The sound is as good as you could hope for in this kind of product. And they never come loose in the ear. I'm a high-mileage runner, many hours per week, and I was nervous about that... but they stay in place better than any set I've had, including the kind with the over-ear ""hanger"". I tried these because I was impressed with some Bose ""full size"" BT headphones, and figured I had nothing to lose since they can be returned. I rarely write reviews, but these headphones are highly recommended."
5	:	"I have had this product 2 weeks so far so I will see how they hold up but so far I love them.. They stay in my ear which is nice since I use them mainly for running and working out and come with three different sizes of ear buds in case you have small or large ears and need something other than the standard size. They paired easily with my phone.. I did download an app for that, and I can go quite a distance away from my phone and still hear the music."
5	:	"Bought as a gift for my husband and he loves them.  Uses them everyday while working outside or other projects he is working on.  Stay in ear and are comfortable, easy to change volume and stay in place."
5	:	These wireless headphones are by far the best Bluetooth headphones I have ever purchased. I've literally gone through 8 different brands of wireless headphones over the past year seeking high quality and powerful output but no other brand has compared to the bose soundsport yet! Bass is amazing. Bose unique wing design looks funny out of the ear but once in SO comfortable and secure in your ear. I train hard in the gym 6 days a week and these headphones he the job done so well and I never have to worry about them falling out or losing an air right seal in my ear canal. Battery life is only 6 hours but who needs to listen to music for more than 6 hours straight? Not me. If you like beats wireless headphones..throw them in the trash and buy a pair of bose soundsport.
1	:	"This is my FIRST Amazon review ever. That is how mad I am. My boyfriend purchased these headphones for me this past December. For the first 3 months, I only charged these headphones in my car with a car charger since I used them for the gym and keeping them in my car meant that I would never accidentally leave my house without them. These headphones NEVER reached 100% battery ever. I assumed it was because I was using a car charger and not an actual outlet charger so I did not think too much into it. But I eventually got fed up and began using the charger at home and would charge them until they reached the green light. STILL, I would turn them on only to hear ""battery at 60%."" What makes it worse is that I would then turn them off, take them to the gym, turn them on again, only to hear ""battery low, please charge now."" They go from 60 to 0 without me using them. How??? WHY?RIDICULOUS. I have yet to hear back from them after filing a complaint. And Amazon, if you guys are selling refurbished/damaged items without telling customers, shame on you."
4	:	"great sound, good volume, like that it is water/sweat resistant. Love the collar clip but I know I will lose it so I bought a bag of aftermarket clips. Got 20 for $6 instead of 1 clip from bose for $4( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0771LVFX2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Battery life is a bit less than advertised. I get about 4 hours out of mine but recharge time is pretty good using my anker wall charger. Charge port cover is delicate but I can't see a better way to do it and still be water resistant an be hidden. It hasn't been a problem for me, just something to be aware of.  I'm not an audiophile but I like bose products and this is another good one.  I thought they would fall out a lot but it really has not been a problem at all."
5	:	"My wife LOVES these headphones and takes them everywhere with her.  She bought a charging case for these (I believe Bose brand from Best Buy), and it was the best complementary purchase for these headphones.  The sound on these holds up to everything you've ever heard about Bose, the Bluetooth connection is rock solid, and they fit the ear canal very well."
5	:	"I use them every time I go to the gym. I run 30 min on the treadmill with them, they don???t fall out.They are not noise cancelling.They come with 3 diff size cushions.The volume max is decent, but not deafining.They last an avg of 4-5 hours.30 min of charge will give me a full workout.They have a control on the wire, next, previous, start/stop, volume +/-, answer/end call.I got them on a Black Friday deal, I would buy again."
3	:	"The sound on these headphones is great and they're comfortable. I use them for both music and phone calls and the problem I have with them is during calls. They sound great for me but the mic picks up all background noise and everyone I speak with can hear EVERYTHING. Little background noise like opening and shutting a cupboard, walking, street noise, etc. sounds REALLY loud to anyone I'm talking to. I'm now looking to replace these headphones solely because of these problems with the mic picking up all background noise."
5	:	"This is the second pair of wireless ""workout"" headphones I have bought.  The first pair were from Jaybird and these Bose headphones are much better.  Better sound quality.  Louder.  Battery lasts much longer.  I was a little worried when I bought them about the size of the ear pieces but it is not a problem at all.  Although they are significantly larger than the Jaybird's they actually fit my ear better, isolate background noise better, and are more comfortable.  They are amazingly light and you can't really tell you are wearing them.  Pairing works perfectly.  You can pair with multiple devices at the same time.  At the gym I watch videos on my iPad but can still receive calls on my iPhone.  I have also started using them as a headset for video-conference calls on my laptop and they are fantastic - better than my old USB headset.  I don't normally spend time writing reviews on Amazon but these things are so good I thought I would.  Well done Bose."
5	:	"After about 5 years of the wired Bose Sport headphones, I was ready to moved into wireless. Since many of my products are Bose already and because of the quality associated, I began researching the quality of this product. I saw that the initial release of this had some issues with regard to sweat, which is what I do most when working out. Bose acknowledged the problem and took steps to resolve the issue. With this version and after the modifications from Bose, there were nothing but positive reviews.With this and my personal knowledge of Bose's quality, I made the purchase. What a great and quality product! While working out, there are ""zero"" issues with this and it fits very comfortably around my knock and in my ear! It looks very cool too while working out and comes with a great little case that you can clip onto workout bag.Also, I don't think they advertise it this way but I tried it as a headset for my phone and it works really well for that also! Bose has done well with this but all of their products I own are ""5 Star!""Oh, the sound is trademake Bose!!"
4	:	"Fantastic sound quality with both music and phone calls.  Microphone works great and these little buggers stay in well.  I must, however, comment on the size.  They are not discreet.  Every time I catch a glimpse of myself while wearing them I realize why people having been giving me absurd looks all day.  You know how the first ever cell phone was like the size of a brick?  It seems as though these have a long way to go in their evolution too.  But luckily I???ve found a great solution to this problem!  Throw on some T-lake ???sexy back??? and envision youself on a catwalk.  I mean really play into this, you???re strutting your stuff hardcore.  Before you know it you???re turning heads simply because you???re so damn fierce.  Trust me, it works every time."
4	:	"I don't have a great ear for sound quality but believe these to be pretty good.  Honestly, I can't tell the difference between them and headphones that are $10.  They are however comfortable and have a decent battery life.  They look a bit Frankensteiny, as they stick out of the ears but I'm an ugly bastard anyway."
1	:	"These headphones are decent. They produce good quality sound at times and do stay in the ears well when exercising. However, I have started to notice that the connection gets very choppy at random times. The distance cannot be the issue because it occurs when I am sitting right by my laptop/phone. For the price/Bose ""quality"" I am pretty disappointed. I will try to get a different brand during Black Friday if I see some good deals.Update: Headphones have completely stopped working six months after purchase. Won't turn on at all. There has been no damage to them whatsoever. I'll make sure to not get Bose products again, and I would definitely recommend that you don't get these headphones. The same issue happened to a friend of mine as well. Absolutely disappointing."
5	:	"I got these bose and I am totally satisfied with my purchase, the battery is long lasting, they come with a customizable ear size (feels weird at first but then are extremely confy)  , and are very easy to use.They fit to the ear so perfectly, and the sound is so amazing, when I returned to use the apple earpids they felt like utter trash, very loose, falling out of my ear, and the sound quality being so much worse than bose.Also, they are fully compatible with my IPhone 6s, showing the battery on the top right of my screen, and the app is truly amazing.The only problem is a buzzing sound when getting these on.Its just a lil buzz, and as soon as you connect to some sort of audio it goes away.Yet, they are still amazing, no regrets"
5	:	"I really like these headphones!  The large ear buds fit my ears and don???t fall out while laying on a weight bench.  The sound quality is very good.  I also like the fact that when you turn the headphones on, they announce how much battery like is left and what the headphones are paired to.  Pairing to an iPhone is simple but  It took a bit of a dance to pair them to my Apple Watch.... Google was my friend and I found the answer.I really like these!"
3	:	"Well, I really wanted to give 5 stars but unfortunately nothing is right about this earbuds other than awesome sound. If your use is minimal than it's unmatched sound quality will do it for you but for others it's too fragile for regular use, things will start to fall apart. I can't answer my calls anymore nor increase the volume because that piece just fell off."
5	:	"I have had the custom earmolds for headphones, JBL and the Jaybird wireless headphones and the sound doesn't even come close to Bose.  The Bose headphones have fantastic base without having to jam and suction them into your ear canal.  Some reviews state that they are big, but you can't tell unless you look in the mirror because the fit is perfect.  I use these headphones for running and they do not flop or loose base.  Very impressive product!"
1	:	"These headphones were not at all noise-isolating. They sounded great, but as a commuter, I was constantly changing the volume to hear. Also they shipped at a baseline level that was way too quiet. I normally have to jack the volume way down for my sensitive ears; I've never had this problem with headphones before. I don't know what kind of seal the tips were supposed to create, but they never worked for me. Because of the proprietary design, they're not replaceable with any other tips which made them functionally useless. I sent them back and returned to my Jaybirds."
3	:	"As great as the sound quality and the comfort of the SoundSport wireless is, it is nearly irrelevant if the battery doesn???t last half of the estimated play time.I have tried plugging them in to various power sources, updated the firmware, and even connected them to different devices - when I take it off the charger, the voice prompt is never consistent. Sometimes it says 50-80%, and lasts about an hour, and the times that it says 100% I usually get the voice prompt telling me to recharge the headset within 90 minutes.Unfortunately, these problems arose after my window for refund had closed with amazon, otherwise they would have been shipped back several weeks ago. It???s a shame that I have to carry a backup pair of wired headphones with me because I just can???t tepy on these."
5	:	"I love everything about these earbuds. They are so comfortable and have fabulous sound. I???ve taken them out several times because I thought I heard something in the house - a bird chirping, a thunk that didn???t belong, stuff like that - only to realize it was part of the video I was watching. I didn???t think I was going to like the wire that holds the two together, but I soon realized that it???s very convenient to take one out of my ear and let it dangle while I leave the other in. Much more convenient than finding a pocket to hold one bud that I might lose. And I love being able to adjust the volume on the earbud wire. The carrying case is small and has a carabiner, so I can hook it to my purse, backpack, or belt loop and have it easily accessible but not have to worry about losing it."
5	:	"I love, love Bose products. The earbuds were encased in a lovely Bose box; it was like opening a gift. The use the earbuds on my daily walk and the sound quality is excellent. It is comfortable to wear and stays charged for a couple to days. I was hesitant to spend over a $100 for a pair of earbuds but I am so happy I did."
2	:	I never thought that I would write a poor review for a Bose product. I purchased these earbuds in August of 2017. It is not even the end of December 2017 and they will not completely charge nor hold a charge for any acceptable length of time even close to when I first got them. I am quite proficient in usages and charging of devices like these as I depend on them for work as well as personal use.  I have never been so disappointed in a device that should have been better quality.
5	:	Great sound & fit.  I use them all the time for running outside & on the treadmill or bike. They stay put in your ears thanks to the multiple 'wings' sizes. They hold a charge for a long time. I can usualy get 4-5+ hourlong workouts in and still have 20-30% more battery life. Charge fast. Still have an old wired pair of Soundsports and like them so much but now have the freedom of being wireless
5	:	these headphones are great. great sound quality. compact. I actually let the cord hang in font instead of behind the neck as most do. the cord actually has a little grip to it and I feel my skin pull it a little which pulls the earbud out of my ear a little. cord in the front no problems. I can tell my ears are a little different sizes though. right ear the ear bud stays perfect. left ear I adjust a lot but that's not the headphones its me. use these to work out. also use these in hot weather and extreme environments because they are durable.
5	:	"This is what it is and does what it's supposed too just fine.  Very easy to use.  Nice for using as a headset in the car as well.  This is better to use than my prior Motorola and Jabra headsets.  This is a headset where talking you hear in both ears and in what seems like a stereo sound.  So nice if your car is a little loud using these inner ear headphones.  As well, you can use them to listen to music.  The only bummer is the short battery life for what you pay but I knew that going into it."
5	:	"I've been using these for several months (4-5, don't remember exactly) already, and I really enjoy them. They have a very good sound, nothing's missing, very comfy switch, you can respond to your calls, change tracks not having to get your phone out. The mic is good, people hear me when I talk to them, however, I push the mic closer when I'm in a crowd. They stay firm in my ears when I walk, run, do workouts, turn my head, etc. When I'm in a gym I leave my phone somewhere and go do sth 3-5 meters away, they still have a great signal (if nothing's in between me and my phone). The only couple of things that maybe not very nice is that if I put my phone in my left pocket, the signal might sometimes be not very good, also, sometimes they fail to find my device if they have been connected to another device, so I have to reboot them a couple of times. But it doesn't bother me."
3	:	I am a grown woman with slightly smaller than average ears and these do not fit well. Very uncomfortable. I traded the original earbuds out for the smallest ones and even those don't fit and something plastic was digging into one of my ears. The eaebuds tips tend to fall off a lot as well. The sound is good and I like the case. But I would not recommend these on a comfort standpoint
1	:	"Rubber seal on the volume peeled up exposing the wiring within a month of regular use and the clip used for connecting them broke. I have to use my phone to adjust the volume or skip to the next song. I called Amazon to replace them; I had 3 more weeks to do so, and they refused to help. They said the warranty was expired. What warranty expires in less than 2 months?? I contacted Bose who agreed to replace them. I???ll update to a more favorable review if the next pair don???t fall apart again."
5	:	"Excellent sound quality and range. The earbuds are comfortable and stay put through rigorous workouts. Last wireless earbuds purchased (not Bose) could not be but only a few feet from the device or they would stop working. With the Bose, I paired with my smartphone, connected, then left my phone at the highest point in my house. I descended six flights of stairs and they still worked perfectly clear! Sold! So, I bought another pair the same day for my S.O."
1	:	"I'd recommend you stay away from these headphones as I've already had two units fail on me. The first unit lasted about 3 weeks until one day it just bricked. It wouldn't power on and whenever I tried charging it (using different USB cables and ports), the charge indicator light would not turn on. Luckily this happened within the return window so Amazon replaced it. Now after another 4  weeks or so, my replacement unit has also bricked. This time the charge indicator light will turn on but when I remove the device from charging, the battery light is stuck on red no matter how long I leave the device charging.I know the odds of two separate units failing on the same customer in such a short time seem unlikely, but I promise you I took good care of both sets. I never took them out in rainy weather or left them inside a hot vehicle. These were great headphones when they worked, but after reading other reviews and my experience, it seems like defective units are way too common."
2	:	I love the wired Bose Soundsport headphones. I hate the wireless ones.Pros:- Good sound quality- Fit pretty wellCons:- The remove control on the right side causes the headphones to pull out of my ear.  I really don't understand why these controls are useful; my phone is easier to reach and change- They aren't really water and sweat resistant... I ran once on a drizzly day and they malfunctioned- The batteries don't keep a charge
2	:	"I've only had these headphones for 4 months now. In the first week or so, I was already having battery issues where sometimes I would plug them in to charge, and the light immediately goes to green, indicating 100% charged. Then I go to use them and the voice tells me there's 30% battery life. A couple times they just wouldn't even turn on which was very frustrating, only to start working again sometime later (like after I've already finished my workout at the gym). And now, the reason I'm writing this review, they are completely dead, haven't turned back on for a couple days now, and every time I plug them in to try and charge them, the light just goes green. So I unplug them and try turning them on, nothing. I guess now I will have to start looking into warranty information and options on either replacing them or repairing them."
3	:	Sound quality is great but in 10 months they are falling apart. They have also started to turn on by themselves with no one touching them. Headphones are in one room and I am not using them and all of a sudden the audio on my computer or phone audio goes off and it is because the headphones have come on.  This is especially great when you are on a call...
5	:	"Sounds pretty okay. The noise cancellation qualities of the design are mixed. At one point I apparently missed a very heated argument among fellow metro riders thanks to these headphones and being seated facing the opposing direction of the fighters (found out because I snapped the view from the train and my friends described the fight from the background audio I missed). On the other hand, I can sometimes hear the train humming. It's almost like higher frequencies are better blocked.Clearer than some more expensive headphones for SOME house music beats and certain EDM effects. BUT...Bass is basically two tones unless the song is well produced. The highest the highs reach are about high mids unless extremely well produced too (which most pop music doesn't even touch).Definitely stay in your ear if you move around a lot. Good for dancing at home. You can literally head bang and they won't budge.Get the Citrine color. No matter how you set it down it somehow manages to look fly as all get up. <3"
2	:	"While these headphones sound awesome, I'd look for another set-up because the volume cover on device came off after about 6-mos & lower volume stopped working.All if this occurred without using in the ""active"" situations said to be made for.Bose customer service sucks because I've tried twice to address this issue as it should be undee warranty, but I can't get a reply!So after being a lifetime fan from 901s until today, I'm moving on b/c paying $149 for what happened is ridiculous!!"
5	:	I absolutely love these! These are the only headphones of mine that do not hurt my ears after wearing for an extended amount of time! I got these to use at school. For anyone planning on getting these I recommend getting the headphone carrying case that also charges the headphones so you can charge them in your bag inbetween uses.
5	:	"Sound is fantastic. Absolutely kills my Beats Wireless. Battery lasts for around 8-10 hours like described. An audio voice chimes when it's powered on, says what it is connected to, and says battery life left, which is awesome. When the battery is low, it chimes in to say when it needs charged. Never had to adjust these after putting them on during the gym, or running. Awesome wireless headphones"
4	:	"Quality of sound it great and so is durability, but I gotta agree with some of my fellow reviewers in that it makes you look a little like Frankenstein's monster.Note: I have a S7 which allows me to change the audio for music. I.e. Adjusting treble, bass, etc. I found that adjusting while wearing the headphones in a quiet environment helped. At first when I listened to them they were a bit meh, but after adjustment they were spectacular."
1	:	"I'd first like to say that the earphones sound amazing and I loved them ""while"" they worked. Within three months the rubber on the volume button pulled out and started giving me problems when trying to answer or release a call. This progressed into the volume randomly turning itself off and even disconnecting calls while in progress. For this I am very disappointed. I've always had good luck with Bose which is why I was more than willing to pay a little more for a better quality product. I would expect to be able to use these longer than six months. I was unable to return them because it was passed the 30 day window with Amazon. Very disappointing."
5	:	"I recently decided to purchase new sports wireless headphones since my beats got stolen. I originally wanted to stick with the Beats brand, but after researching, I decided to go with Bose. At first I was a bit hesitant to purchase the headphones, they didn???t have ear hooks, but I do not regret my purchase. Bose sound-sports stay put. Additionally, Bose sound-sports definitely have a better sound quality than my former Beats. The only thing I don???t like is that they kinda stick out of making them appear bulky, but they are light."
5	:	"These are an Excellent headset, Sound is clean and clear, I bought these for the Heart rate monitor which I find works great, very motivating they really help you stay in your zone. There are times when the monitor number can jump to scary high beats, I felt good so I just readjust the earpiece. I actually did get myself checked which certainly is not a bad thing and all is well. Happy Training!"
1	:	"I have always been a BOSE advocate but these are horrible. I am on my 5th pair, 4th replacement pair. They last anywhere from 2 uses to 2 months but will eventually break. They can't handle ANY amount of sweat. This has been a HUGE WASTE of my TIME (30-45 min per call each time for replacements) and they have been out of my possession more than they have been in my possession. I asked for a refund and they refused. So I guess it's $150 in the trash cause I will at some point surrender to the calls. BOSE THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!  DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU EXERCISE AT ALL!"
3	:	"They sound ok, when they aren???t half hanging out of your ear, disconnected, or out of battery.  Even when sitting still they fall out, no matter what ear piece I try.  If i switch devices I have to delete the previous pairing and start over, every time. They are completely useless for sports.  Maybe other wireless earbuds suffer the same deficiencies.  But these are almost complete dysfunctional."
5	:	"Amazing sound.  Not too loud but that happens when one prefers sound quality than loudness.  Maybe technology will be able to make bluetooth earphones with superb sound quality and very loud music.  I have tried all what are supposed to be the best bluetooth sport earphones, and this ones are among the best 3 right now"
5	:	After reading all the mixed reviews I hesitated but continued to buy these based on a recommendation from a friend boy am I glad I did these things sound twice as good as the old set that I was using and more comfortable I haven't used them all day at work yet so I'm hoping that the battery life is good enough for a whole day but I will try charging during breaks and that should keep me going
5	:	"Great sport headphones! It's a major bonus that they're noise cancelling, it makes going to the gym a little bit more enjoyable when I can't hear what other people are doing. They work incredibly well, and they're easy to bring along with you for workouts, commutes or time in coffee shops when you just need a little extra quiet. I love that they're bluetooth so I can easily stream a workout and/or listen to instructions and watch my screen without having to stay connected to my phone. The only downside for me: I have incredibly small ears, and even the smallest ear insert is still a little bit too big, so when I do vigorous activity the buds can slip out. It doesn't happen often, and using the clip helps keep it to a minimum, but some adjusting does happen."
5	:	"The sound on these headphones bests the cheaper Mpow and Anker in-ear Bluetooth headphones I own, and they stay in place better than either (sometimes with a bit more jiggling than I would like to seal in, I swear my ears must expand or shrink depending on the weather, some days more challenging than others). The build-quality is high as well, very premium feel. Definitely worth the price I'd say, after a month of use, my favorite headphones by far. (As an aside, obviously the battery life could be better, but I am rarely away from a charge, so hasn't proven to be a problem as of yet.)"
1	:	"These sound amazing and are super comfortable. A great replacement for my powerbeats2. Edit*Bose has a serious problem with these headphones. The first pair I purchased would not charge fully so I returned them for a new pair. The new pair worked fine then stopped turning on. I contacted Bose and thry gave me instructions to ""fix"" the problem ( plug in charger and wait 10 sec,  unplug and wait 1 min, turn on). The ""fix"" only worked 2 weeks now they will not turn on at all. Updating via computer did not help. The logos on my second pair fell off after light use because whoe er installed them had greasy fingers ( there was a greasy substance under the logos). An internet search will reveal that this is a common issue. I would not recommend these until Bose acknowledges and fixes this issue."
5	:	"Purchased these as a Christmas present and have been told they are great. So much so that within hours of using them a 2nd pair was purchased for the household. The sound quality is what you would expect from Bose and they lock into your ears great. I also have the Quietcontrol 30 headphones from Bose that have a similar system than these to stay in your ear and love how they lock in. I have traditionally been more of a fan of the ""over the ear"" headphones since I have trouble getting earbuds to stay in my ears, but do not have trouble with the Bose. Great product that is worth the investment."
4	:	"Out of the box, it had great sound, easy to pair, and stayed in my ears. As much as I loved the sound from my Klipsch ""Sport"" earbuds, they didn't stay secure...which is why I'm loving the Bose. They fit out of the box, they don't move around at all. 4-Stars instead of 5 is it's harder to listen at lower volumes, even laying in bed in the evening for a quiet read I've had to keep the volume at 1/3rd or higher to hear anything. The bass is a bit much, wish there was more tweaking I could do with  the Bose Control app.**I am an avid mountain biker, I ride a hardtail and these have stayed put over some of the biggest roots and fast descents I could find. Best in my book."
2	:	"I have owned these after switching from Powerbeats 3 over ear.... I really like the sound quality but after 8 months the wire between the headphones split, something that never happened on any of the 3 pairs of powerbeats.  I contact warranty services who promptly told me their warranty is 12 months from manufacture date and not retail sale as specifically indicated in their warranty materials.  I hope this gets corrected but I take the approach that I shouldn't have to explain a company's warranty to them and I am now wasting my time tying to get a simple process completed.  Their warranty services are off-shore so poor oversight might be to blame here.  I gave 2 stars because maybe I just got the crappy pair since the sound is good."
1	:	"I sent an email through Bose???s customer support website last January regarding a problem with my earphones, and I have not heard anything back from Bose after TWO months. I am now posting this in Amazon in the hopes that someone is monitoring the site and will respond to me.The 1-year warranty on my earphones just ended in January when a few days later, the covering of the right earbud unravelled and I could no longer use the cover to turn the earbuds on or off.Having paid $150 for this product, I expected that it would last longer than 1 year (never mind that the weak clip it came with to attach to clothing broke within a month), and that there is a way to replace the cover on the right earbud.Will anybody respond to me this time?"
5	:	"I tried a highly-rated, much less expensive brand of bluetooth headphones.  Those paled in comparison to these.  The Bose headset has MUCH better sound quality, easier to use controls, and pairs more easily to my phone.  Sound quality for making phone calls has proved to be good as well.  I wish I hadn't spent $30 on the others first, and had just gone straight to a high-quality product."
5	:	"I didn't really know what to expect since I've never owned wireless headphones. I became tired of my old iPod headphones that I used at the gym. They kept falling out of my ears and the cable also bothered me. So this was my chance on trying something new. Charging and turning on were very easy. It took me a while to figure out which size of ear plugs I needed, but they are easy to change and come in 3 different sizes. I charged the headphones over night and used them the very next morning at my gym and I LOVE them! I ran 1 hr on the treadmill and there was no falling out of my ears, no cord that was bothering me and no connection issues at all. By the way the Bluetooth connection with my iPod and my Samsung S7 were super easy."
4	:	"These headphones are the best for your fitness needs! I had done a bunch a research on wireless sport headphones, and ultimately decided to try Bose Soundsport because these aren't inner ear buds. They use silicone tips that rest on the outside of your ear canal, which I prefer because my hearing won't get fatigued too quickly. These don't cancel out ambient noise, so beware if that's an important for you. The sound quality is still really great, super clean sounding and no bass overkill. These will definitely improve my runs and lifting sessions since I don't have to hassle with wires anymore. Only thing that bothered me was that there was significant wind noise when I was running into the wind. It's not a deal breaker for me, but I did notice it. Might not be ideal for cyclists because of that. Overall though, I'm really happy I ended choosing the Bose Soundsport headphones. They are comfortable, have great sound, and don't hinder your workout with wires."
3	:	"Best sound it there, however after 4 months of use, the battery only last a couple hours, it seems like it went bad because it only take a few minutes to charge.  Before spending $150 check out ""old shark"" for $10.  I know it is cheap but I've had 3 different brands and was surprised at the sound, and only $10.  But you have to get them in the ear good to get the best sound."
4	:	"Purchased them in December 2016. Had them for one and a half years. For that entire time, they worked great, had great sound and stayed in my ear during vigorous exercise. However, about a year into owning them, the volume down button stopped working. And just this week (a year and a half mark) the left ear bud has stopped working. I reset, factory reset, and updated them. No luck. I guess their durability as being sweat proof is a little exaggerated. Disappointed they only lasted a year/year and a half.  I guess that???s why they have a one year warranty.  However, they were used 5-6 times a week and I tend to sweat a lot/live in a hot environment.  But with bose, I???d expect a little better durability.Update 7/13/2018: Bose agreed to send a replacement set of headphones. Top notch customer service and great experience with them. Changing from 3 to 4 stars."
5	:	"I love the freedom you get with the new wireless model, I own the wired model as well, they both have great design, major differences are:Wireless:The new tips make a tighter seal, they damp a little bit ambience sound and you might have to take them off to have a conversation.Volume level is lower than the wired model.Again they are very confortable to wear, great sound and bass level, decent battery life, they're my favourite new friends every time I go out for a run."
3	:	"I purchased these because I needed wireless earbuds for the Apple Watch 3 and love Bose speakers.  This is the first time I have been disappointed in a Bose product.  They do not work with the Apple Watch 3.  I have had the Apple Watch for about two weeks and have only been able to listen to music once through the earbuds.  The connect to the watch and then the connection fails.  I investigated the problem on-line and discovered that many people are experiencing the same problem.  I have tried repeatedly to fix the problem based on reviews and discussion boards on-line.  Nothing seems to work.  They sound fine and seem to work well with other bluetooth devices (thus, 3 stars instead of 1 or 2), but if you are buying these to use with the Apple Watch, you should look elsewhere.I purchased these in November because they were on sale and then delayed too long in getting the watch.  Now, I can't return them to Amazon because the return date on these has passed.  I'm stuck with earbuds that do not work with the device for which I purchased them.  At least I can say I learned something..."
3	:	"Great sound and comfortable headphones. These are the first pair of headphones that I found that stay in my ear comfortably. Wish the battery life was a little better but it's not a big deal. Just charge them every other day and you should be good.My only gripe is I've gone through two pairs since March already. First pair lasted till June. The replacement pair lasted about 2 months. Both times, the issues were the same. They won't turn on or charge. Not sure what could be causing it. Very rarely do I run in the rain with them. I do sweat a lot when I workout so I'm guessing that's it even though it's suppose to be sweat and water resistant. If I could get something else to try I would but Bose won't do anything other than send me a replacement."
5	:	I love them ????. I'm in the when I have my bose in my ear..
3	:	"I ordered these headphones in February and at first I loved them. I have used them almost every day since I got them and overall they are a good product. I like the fit of these versus the Power Beats that wrap over my ear, they have great sound quality, and have been durable(my Power Beats had to be replaced in under a year due to a cosmetic defect). However, over the last 6 months I have noticed a decrease in battery life, thus the 3 star review.  When I first got them the battery would last around 8-9 hours of consistent use before needing to be recharged. Lately I have been lucky to get about 4 hours out of a full charge. Overall, I am mostly satisfied with the headphones but I probably wouldn't buy them again."
1	:	Doesn't seem to stay in while running. Maybe it is too large. Also when on the phone the quality is poor. Can't use.
2	:	"I have owned these headphones for about a year and am not able to recommend them.  The battery life is dreadful.  I leave them on charge all night and, within about two hours of usage, they are flat again.  They often just shut down with only a few minutes' warning.  The headphones almost never indicate 100% charge - even when they have been charging for 12+ hours continuously - and, if they do, such lasts no time whatsoever.  Many reviewers have commented on the stingy length of the charging cord - which I consider a small detail (though given that I must use it at least once daily, perhaps should not discount it so) - but, really, it's the operational limitations which are really the issue for me.  I would definitely not buy this product again."
3	:	"Overall these were pretty good, but for the price I expected exceptional sound.  It was crystal clear but did not sound like it had any power behind the sound.  I have lower priced headphones that sound better than these did.I will admit though that Bose did a fantastic job at ergonomics.  Possibly one of the best fitting ear buds I have ever used."
5	:	"I've tried a handful of different ear buds (wired and bluetooth), and this is the only pair I've been able to wear for more than an hour without crippling discomfort. The sound quality is better than it has to be for me, the battery life is impressive, and pairing/connection stability has been flawless."
1	:	"Great sound, but I need these for voice calls and the microphone is WAY too sensitive.  People on facetime, voicecalls, etc complain that they hear people in the room more clearly than me. This is a COMMON problem and documented for well over a year.  Should have done a bit more due diligence.  Unless I find a firmware update to correct this, these are going back.  A shame since their wired equivalents are great.  don't know why they couldn't use the same microphone in these.  Terrible."
1	:	"These headphones look great, sound great, and -- in my experience with two pairs -- work terribly. Both times I used the headphones 4 or 5 times during a workout, and then they stopped pairing via Bluetooth to my iPod. I've had many Bose products, and the customer support has been great. Figured for sure I could get the SoundSports working again. Sadly, Bose's famous customer support has deteriorated to the kind of outsourced call center where the overseas agent repeats your statement of the problem and is then out of options on what to do. For example, I asked the agent if many people were having problems pairing their headphones to a Bluetooth device, and she just repeated everything I said without replying. So back go the second pair. Maybe I'm unlucky -- thousands of people have given SoundSports lots of stars. They sounded great when they worked, but they've got to work all the time to be considered acceptable."
2	:	"The sound is good but the fit and finish seriously needs some work!  The rubber volume control buttons some how came out and are now flapping around, the Bose stickers on the sides of the earbuds came off (I found one and super-glued it back into place.  Lost the other side)  Considering the price (lucky I got these on sale) I really expected more from a company like Bose.  My off brand Amazon lightning deal specials have a better QC with their buttons."
2	:	"I plan to replace these earphones soon, after about 1 year of moderate use.  The problem:  they do not hold a charge for more than a day or two.  If you check the charge, it will say 100% only to tell you low charge and go off after 15 minutes use.  As a result, one has to charge these fully before each use if you expect to use them for more than 15 minutes. If you don't, you never know whether you will be able to use them for an exercise routine. Otherwise, the product is quite excellent:  comfortable fit; do not fall out during exercise; very good sound; good controls; good blue tooth connection with the iphone.  They are a bit large in relationship to the ear but that may explain the excellent sound. At this price, I view the charge problem as a major defect since it prevents use."
1	:	"Let me start by saying that I love Bose products.  But, these headphones are a joke.  They were new when I got them, but the quality is awful.  The button for the sound started giving me trouble within a month of getting the product and now, it won't even stay in.  Not to mention that the covering on the earbuds themselves has stretched to the point that the on off toggle button fell off when I took them out of my ears.  I had my previous bluetooth from Bose and it lasted over two years with being in constant use; this one didn't make it that long."
5	:	"Absolutely awesome! Sound is rich and clear (was a bit underwhelming at first, but I guess they broke in). Fit can't be better. Use them 6 days a week for either running or weight lifting. Never came close to falling out. As far as the bluetooth signal, occasional hiccups when the gym is crowded - I think this has to do with interference from other's bluetooth devices. These work great for me and I've tried countless buds for working out. Had for 3 months and durability is fine so far. Even if they break in a year, I'd buy them again ... they really are that good for my needs."
2	:	"I would have given a high rating to this product if it only concerned the quality of sound. Unfortunately the button for sound and skipping forward started breaking down just after a year of owning it and its worth noting that the product did not get a lot of usage during that first year so it seems crazy it should have been breaking so soon. I did however continue to use it and just found it annoying to deal with the button that didn't work good. But, now, today a year and half after purchase the head phones totally stopped working by emitting a loud crackling buzzing sound in my ear, would not shut off, just had to set it down and let the battery wear out. I feel like they should last longer then this so I can't give a good rating. Too bad as I generally like Bose products in the past."
1	:	"I bought this product the first time during Thanksgiving and I absolutely loved it. But I lost the headphones a few days after. I had liked them so much that I ordered them again immediately. That's where my problems started. The product I received the second time had a cut on the power button, and the wire below the sound control was kinda distorted. It was not expected from Bose. I returned the item and as I really wanted them I asked them to send me a replacement rather than a refund. The third time I received the product, the power button again had problems. This time they were too hard to power on. Button was sort of like sunken into the body already. My fingers hurt each time I pushed the power button. This was my third product so I definitely knew how the power button worked on the previous two I had. Sadly I think there is something wrong with current lot Amazon has. I returned them again, and this time asked for a refund."
2	:	"Great sound. Very comfortable. Most in ear earbuds like these always fall out of my ears. But I could walk with these, do housework, and do almost anything. But, they???re way too fragile. After a couple months of putting them in and out of my pocket the lining came off, and Bose said the warranty doesn???t cover that. Thankfully Amazon let me return it, even though it was past the return period."
2	:	"I bought these mostly because of the Bose name.  I expected them to be like all the other Bose products I've used -- excellent.  But that isn't the case here.  Here are my gripes:- Range: my range is about 10 feet, not the 10 meters that Bluetooth is supposed to have.  Farther than 10 feet, and sound quality deteriorates significantly.- Battery: only the top 30% of the battery is usable.  Once the battery goes below 70%, sound quality is bad.- Audible announcements: These are nice, but they blank out the phone call.  If you are listening to someone and a call comes in, forget it.  You can only hear the headphones, and when the headphones read the entire number digit by digit, that's a lot of conversation that you miss out on.- Random dropouts and quality issues: I'll be talking to someone with the phone nearby, and all of a sudden they will say they can't hear or understand me.- Strange behavior: sometimes when I end a call, my phone magically starts playing music, even though there wasn't music playing before the call.On the plus side, these fit my ears well, and they stay in, even when I have just one side in and the rest of the headphones dangling from that ear."
5	:	"Well! I just love my BOSE and the one thing I know they can do better is the clip-on it shouldn't be so easy to be displaced as mine has already lost and I only realized that after the FACT, so please back to the drawing for that clip-on. It's to easy to escape doing the job of protecting from dropping of your neck when not in use"
5	:	"My boyfriend ADORES these. He is a runner and previously had some wireless headphones that died on him. We ordered these as a replacement, and he can't say enough about them! These are also great for airplanes, because you can keep your phone in your pocket or purse and still listen to music."
5	:	"Much better sound quality than previous bluetooth headphones I've tried. These are a bit bulky though, so you won't be able to fit them under a cap for winter running. They hold a solid bluetooth connection with my phone/watch when running or working out and the battery life seems good enough."
2	:	"My initial review was 4 stars, but I have to update it because I've had a lot of issues since then. After a bit over a year of daily use, I had an issue with the battery. No problem, I got protection and they replaced the headphones for free. I've had the replacements for about a month and I'm now having different battery issues. I'm not sure if I've just gotten two bad pairs, but my love for these headphones has really soured. I'm not sure if they will replace the headphones again, but if they don't, I'm not going to buy another pair. I don't personally feel that they're worth the $150 pricetag."
1	:	Extremely disappointed with Bose and Amazon. I purchased this as a present for Christmas and just after 4 months the battery life would drop after a full charge straight to 40% then dies after 2 hours. What a shame the audio is awesome and is perfect for working out and on the job. I'm sure no one with amazon will make this right and it is sickening because of the price you pay to have nice equipment but at least I can help someone else from purchasing a defect product. I never review a product but this is ridiculous!
4	:	"These headphones are pretty great. Theyre super comfy and never fall put of my ears. Theyre adequately loud for earbuds and crystal clear. With that said, these are unusable outdoors. Any amount of wind will cause so much wind noise that you wont hear the music. Just keep that in mind"
4	:	"So far I like these ""budget"" wireless headphones. They stay in my ears and hold a charge well. I did notice once when I was in a location where many other people were on their phones, the connection was spotty. Bluetooth interference? But other than that, no breakups or lost connection, good sound. The instruction manual could be formatted by language rather than topic, so you don't have to flip through the folded pages to find the info you need."
4	:	"Sound quality is excellent, battery life is also very good. Buds are slightly heavy, which wouldn't be an issue with a neckband design, but because of the use of a small clip to attach it to clothing, this weight can have the headphones leaning from one side to another, and usually results in slipping out of the clothes clip.In fact, this was such an issue that I ended up losing the clip altogether. I've made do without it, but it's a lever of inconvenience that I think could be addressed. I'm surprised that Bose, a company with such a high standard of quality in their products, didn't consider this when designing these headphones.But, as I said before, the headphones sound great and work beautifully, so I can't complain too much about not having a clip."
1	:	These headphones sound great if you can get them to Bluetooth pair. You can't have your phone too close or too far or they constantly break up. It's terrible. You basically have to hold you phone by your head to get them to pair so what is the point?? Don't bother. These are expensive garbage.
4	:	Bought these for my 17 year old son.  sound is pretty good but sound isolation is not that good and the volume level cannot overcome.  I'll stick with my etymotic custom earbuds (wired) until the technology get there.  They do however stay in your ear pretty secure and battery life is great.
2	:	"I purchased these headphones on February 24, 2018. Today's date is June 29, 2018, and I am extremely disappointed in the durability of this item. I utilize these headphones 5 days per week during my morning and evening commute from New Jersey to New York. I enjoy the sound quality of the headphones, however the housing is far below what is expected for a pair of $200 earbuds. I have several Bose products in my home,  and chose these headphones over the Beats by Apple because I knew that the sound quality would be superior. However, in 4 short months, the rubber that is used to cover the earbuds, and remote control have warped and become extremely loose. Also the earbud covers have lost their elasticity, and do not stay positioned on the earbud. I must say that I am not happy with this product."
4	:	The sound and pairing are decent with these headphones and they seem to last longer than their wired counterparts. However the clip is weak and broke less than a year after owning them. My boyfriend ordered the same headphones around the same time and had a similar experience. Don't be surprised when yours breaks.
5	:	"Sometimes you get what you pay for and this is one of those cases. My 4 year old pair of pricey Jaybirds quit working and I tried to replace them with 2 different pair of $25-$30 highly rated earbuds. Neither pair was comfortable and one of them stopped working after a week. So I reluctantly pulled the trigger on the Bose wireless and it's been worth the money. They are extremely comfortable, sound great, and the battery life is excellent. After 2 hours of use I still have 80% battery left. There is an app that you can download from Bose that has a battery life indicator as well as other features. Can't speak to long term reliability but thus far I am very happy I spent the money and am loving the headphones."
4	:	"I tried this wireless earbuds at Bose Store last weekend and I liked it very much so I ordered it few days ago.  No wireless earbuds will come close to the wired earbuds sound quality but this is a nice product.  I purchased this so that I could wear it during my workout and it stayed in my ears.  Bass was good considering it was a wireless earbuds.  It may look a little bulky compare to other brands but for me, the sound quality is what I care most and I am very satisfied.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who's in the market for wireless earbuds."
4	:	"Great product, sounds good, battery life is reasonable, accompanying app is nice. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is due to the fact that they are a little bulky. Sure I read a lot of reviews about them before buying them and some of them mentioned the size but I did not expect them to be so big. There is no functional issue with the size, since they hold up pretty good and they don't fall down or anything it is more of an aesthetics thing for me."
5	:	"So far so good. These wireless earbuds are a life changer. I can run more easily without having to worry about the wires slipping out of my ear. As a female, clothes with pockets are hard to come by, even workout clothes. Now I can just put my phone down and do whatever workout I need. (Or I'll use a fanny pack) I'm so mobile!!"
2	:	"The battery for these is just awful. I charge them at a 100% each night, unplugged them off the charger and come back the next day, you'll find battery at either 80-70%, leave them there unplugged for another night and you'll find them battery completely dead. The sound is great, the fit nice, I'm sorry bu, for the price I paid for these to roughly get only 2 hours of battery, having to charge them so often, just not worth the $140ish. I'll try the beats next time"
4	:	"As an avid runner i love these headphones. The sound quality is great, the ear buds fit my oddly shaped ears well, and the battery life is substantial. However, after less than one year of frequent use (>5hrs per day) the cables have begun to fall apart, the material housing the power button is coming off, the power button itself is no longer usable and I have to press the actual microchip to turn it on (there???s no longer a way to turn them off outside of plugging them in to charge), the shirt clip has broken, and the volume control no longer works. I still give this product a 4 star overall rating due to the high quality of the sound and amount of use I???ve gotten out of them, but its frustrating to know that this product has a lifespan of less than a year if you are using it heavily, especially for the cost."
1	:	I am very disappointed with this purchase. Do NOT buy these for the heart rate monitor. It works spotty at best. Constantly loses signal even though still connected to Bluetooth. And the phone ap is absolutely abysmal. Tells you Bluetooth is not connected while playing music through Bluetooth. Seems like a big fail as Bose seems to not be the company of quality and upscale products they once were.  They sound great and work well in the gym and on the running trail but there are better out there for less $$$
3	:	"Got these for jogging. They generally do the trick. Occasionally they'll begin to cut out - and once it starts it just keeps happening until I finish the run. Was using Apples AirPods before this and they truly suck in this regard. I'm just assuming all bluetooth headphones will cut out. Tends to happen when I sweat or pour water over my head mid-run. Could also be the ancient iPhone SE I'm using. Who knows. Also feel like they could amplify a bit more, but they form a good seal on your ear so you don't get ambient sound. Always look both ways before crossing the street."
4	:	"Really great quality, but would like to see some software updates. Mic picks up a lot of surrounding noises, unlike my wired Bose headphones, but haven't had major complaints on multiple work conference calls. Ringer volume when wearing needs serious update as it is extremely loud."
5	:	awesome head phones. absolutely blown away by quality. I peeled off the bose logo plastic disks on the side and glued small disc magnets in their place so they could magnet together when i take them out of my ears.
5	:	"The downside of wireless is that the ear pieces are huge!!! But amazingly, even though I have itty bitty ear canals, these phones stay put with a little twist and do not come out until I want them to. It feels like my stereo system is in my head. Amazing. Love them."
5	:	"Great product. Its been 2years I have them. Awesome for daily stuff and also workouts.Battery life is about 3hrs or so if you constantly use it. I do feel discomfort in my ears after extended use (meaning more than an hour). sometimes, when making phone calls) the volume automatically increase and it is very annoying and uncomfortable.But other than these I am very happy with it"
4	:	"Just got these! The sound is fantastic. I'm sitting at the gym using them for the first time- I haven't done my HIIT yet so that will be the true test to see if they stay in. I have small ears but the small fitting seem to feel secure. My only negative- they stick out so far!! I actually noticed someone else with them at the gym (a man) and the reason I could identify them was bc they stuck out from his head too! They def have more substance than small ear buds- you can't see the ""stick out "" that great in this picture but I don't sit at the gym and take 20 selfies! Will update after I do cardio about how well they stay in"
5	:	"One of the best pair of wireless headphones I???ve ever purchased. Had these for 2 weeks now, great sound and noise cancellation; they arrived on time and the battery life is great. One of my biggest issues with other wireless headphones that i sweat too much and after some time the sweat effects the headset to it malfunctions and starts tweaking. The way these headphones are engineered sweat will not go leak into the controls on the headset or the mic. The fit is really great, only set of headphones that stayed in place when doing burpees. The only drawback of these headphones are they don???t always pair as quickly as Beats headphones (which obviously have an arrangement with apple), usually they pair immediately when turning on but if you toggle sound back in forth from iPhone speaker to wireless head set you may have to manually pair in settings or the Bose app. You can download to add to the convenience of pairing."
5	:	"Incredible headphones, completely cancel out the noise around. Stay in your ears easily, 3 separate sizes come in the box so you are sure to find one that fits you well. Also love the carrying case. A little strange to get used to charging the headphones since these are my first wireless case, but the battery lasts quite a while so only have to do it every once in a while."
5	:	"I love these headphones and I use them for everything. I listen to music while I run marathons or lift weights, take conference calls on the go/in the car. The sound quality is so nice on these headphones I can take conference calls while I'm running (as long as I'm not doing too much talking). The battery life is good, the fit is secure, the sound quality is excellent... It's Bose!"
5	:	"I love Bose and these headphones did not disappoint. I have a heard time finding bud headphones that will stay in my ears while doing high-intensity workouts or running, but Bose has the only headphone that I have found to stay in, even if I'm sweaty. Also, the sound is amazing, but I would expect nothing less from the brand."
1	:	Please don't purchase this. The battery decreases overtime and is horrible. And the recharge time to get 100% takes FOREVER! I wore the small size and the still fall out! Although I still kept it just for the sound quality. By the time I realized the battery and recharge time was horrible. The return period already ended.
5	:	"My first set was Beats. I did love them but the busier the gym got the more they got staticy. I decided to try the Bose and I'm thrilled. Super easy to pair, no static, really long range. And then endure unbelievable sweat."
5	:	"These ear buds are seriously so great. Bose never disappoints with their products. These earbuds surprisingly fit really well in my ear. This was a big concern of mine because I do have smaller ears, but the product came with three different sizes. I used the size small and it fits comfortably in my ear. As for sound quality, I???d have to say it is much better than any other wireless earbud I???ve had. Also it is very easy to connect the Bluetooth to my phone. One thing I wish was better was the battery life. I wear my earbuds around campus and the battery dies within 5-6 hours and it???s sometimes an inconvenience to have to charge it. Overall great product and I would definitely recommend to a friend."
5	:	"I've had mine for two week and I sweat buckets. These not only stand up to that they stay in the ear and track you heart rate quiet well. Far more comfortable than the band around the chest that often chafes you during a run. Most important they are extremely comfortable in your ear. I have always had a problem finding ear headphones that don't hurt my ears and these are so comfortable I find myself forgetting they are there and just enjoying the music while running. Great product, great sound (I am not an audiophile so keep that in mind if you are), and all around great price point for what it does. Thanks Bose!To be clear this is NOT a paid advertisement. I just really enjoy the product, especially as it blocks out all the traffic sounds that the park I go running in has, as it's right next to a major traffic."
1	:	"sound quality is ok not that great but the quality sucks, I just had them for 3 months and they're already falling apart, the buttons are coming off, the bose stickers on the sides of the headphones are coming off as well and the battery last less than 5 hours."
5	:	"the sound is just amazing. Easy to sync and the battery life is great.I use it while strength training, walking and running. They hold steady in my ears.Whether you workout or not, this is a great buy if you are looking for bluetooth headphones."
4	:	"I like this product, but now it???s falling apart. Durability should be a rating category because in my opinion, the product is not very durable. I use these earphones daily and store them in a small pouch from another device when not in use. I am not sure why the sound adjustment area is falling apart. Is there any warranty on them? I expect better from Bose. The clip separated from the device not long after I started using it. Other than the durability, the product is great. The charge lasts well. It???s compact and easy to use but not a distraction to keep around my neck."
5	:	"I've actually had a pair of these for about 2 years now and this was purchased for another person. However, these headphones have always been very user friendly and had very clear sound and voice commands. I've never had a problem with the battery life or charging them. I would recommend these to anyone looking for an updated pair of headphones for working out or leisure. Especially if you are on the fence about going to truly wireless headphones or not."
2	:	"Best fit and best sound BUT after just 6 weeks of owning these, they won't hold a charge. I leave them plugged in for hours and when I turn them on the battery is usually either 40% or 60% and then they die within an hour or less. Plug them back in, the battery is 100% then they die in 5 minutes. It's all over the place. Definitely not the kind of quality I expected from Bose. It really sucks because these are otherwise the best headphones I have ever had."
5	:	This is my second pair. I lost the first after a year of frequent use. The sound quality is very good (for buds) and the fit is good. They stay in better than any other bud I have tried. The Bluetooth range is very good. I just wish I could get more than 3 hours of battery life.
1	:	"So disappointing for its price. It disconnects and dies at 30%, and the charger cover refuses to close. The ear piece falls off constantly, too. With an investment like this, and as a big fan of Bose active headphones, this has been the most disappointing purchase."
5	:	"Deserve 10 stars!! Researched these and it paid off! The rare ""open design"" lets them rest comfortably against the ear instead of being crammed into the ear canal but still get great bass response. Eartips comfortably keep them in place. Can hear people speak to you and hear cars when riding a bike!They are all that was promised!!!Had a weak battery after few months. Prepaid return drop at UPS, replaced new set delivered 3 days later. No hassle. Great customer service."
4	:	"The whole product is pretty great with the exception of the mic on the headphones. They pickup everything and it will frequently overpower your own voice on conversations. I have had people on the other end of my call be able to hear what people are saying in other rooms. If you are looking for something to take calls on, pick something else. If you are just looking for something to listen to music on, you are good."
4	:	"I like the design of the SountSport from Bose. The various sized ear adapters let you pick the one that fits right. I must have giant ears or something because I use the large. But even with the large, the weight of the bluetooth set still pulls them out of the ear slightly. Still a good set though."
4	:	"The sound quality is awesome, its almost gets you high.Its not a happy ending story.There are certain features that need improvement.ConsFirstly, Battery life The battery life did disappoint me at first as it couldn't last as expected plus I had to use it in survival mode to make it last the whole day.2. The wires around the neck need some kind of housing or a different material because it sticks to the skin and is kind of annoying.3.The voice prompt needs a lot of work as it will list every device that is connected and is a pretty robotic voice.Pros1. SOUND QUALITY IS UNMATCHABLE.Its performance dwindles in low volume due to the non isolation feature (The earphones will never drop even when gou run).2.Bose connect works like a charm, it helped me switch the voice prompt off for starters which is great.3 .Worth the money."
5	:	I have gone through sooo many wireless headphones. Amazon can attest to it. I???ve gone through 3 beats & countless other ones. But since Bose came into my life wow... just wow. Quality sound!! Battery reminder when you turn off or on. Automatically connects to my phone. Battery life is amazing. If you are a gym rat or runner you know how important it is to have quality headsets. These are the ones !!
1	:	"Started falling apart roughly 6 months into owning them, various pieces would fall off like the bose logo on the side, the sound volume button rubber, and the rubber around each ear. I took good care of them, left them in a case when unused. At the 13 month mark, it randomly shut off despite having a full charge and will not turn back on."
5	:	Got them and love them! I had bought the beats wireless and the sound was terrible and quickly returned them. Since I love my Bose speakers I decided to give these a try. The instant I turned them on I knew they were keepers. Great sound and they don't come off so they are perfect for exercising with them.
4	:	"I decided to spend the extra money and switch from using the LG Tone Pro headset. At first I made the mistake of switching to the smallest tips for what I thought would be a more comfortable fit. This was a mistake because I had a hard time keeping the bud inside the ear. I switched back to the mid sized tip and it was a remarkable difference in comfort & sound. It took some getting used to as I was used to a different style earbud but I'm really digging these buds. They stay in place while running, at work in a warehouse environment, and even motorcycling.The battery life doesn't last as long as the LG, but the quality of sound and in-call performance are super. Even in a noisy environment, I can hear the calls fine and the person on the other end has no difficulty hearing me."
2	:	"This is not one of Bose top products. I have many Bose products and this is poor in my opinion. Base - what base, If you like twang then you are good because there is no base. I use them to exercise and I sweat a good deal, no they do not stay in. Volume - put it this way I can carry on a conversation and have the volume up all the way. So no do not recommend if you want to use the to work out."
1	:	"I purchased these on December 12, 2016. Today, February 2, 2018 (less than two months) the stop/advance feature does not work. At this price, I would have expected these to last at least a year. Sorry- Bose quality continues to slip in recent years."
5	:	"Value for money... Gets paired with my ipod nano easily... Had no issues in pairing with my Nexus phone as well... Heart rate monitor is a waste I feel as I always need to have my bulky phone with me to track it... The Bose application doesn't offer any valuable insights...perhaps they can improve here.... I would say, go for the non heart rate head phones and save 50 buks... Having said that, the earphone is good, low base is pretty good, it fits to ur ears without any problem... All in all a great product worth the money except for the heart rate...."
5	:	These things are worth the money! They are comfortable to wear and they sound great. I don't like buds that block a lot of the background noise because I wear them outside and like to be able to hear cars etc. Huge bonus is they will sync with my tablet and phone at the same time for time when I am on the treadmill or other equipment.
5	:	Great Earphones:I'm impressed with these earphones. I thought Jaybird X3 has the edge over these. I was wrong until I've started using these. Perfect balance of sound & Comfortable buds stays in the ears. I use these when I workout & running. Never lost the grip.No noise cancellation & Better battery life would have been better.
5	:	"Tremendous product.  You can be in a wind tunnel and people on the other end will be able to hear what you are saying on a call as if you were speaking in a library.  Great sound, great battery life and stands the test of time.  I normally don't review products for long after i buy them.  I bought the headphones almost 2 years ago and they are working like the first day i bought them."
5	:	these are awesome!  they actually stay in.  they don't make any annoying squishy noises with every step.  I returned two other similarly priced sets before I finally found these gems.  Game changer!
4	:	"They sound fantastic. Very well made. The problem is they are open. That means you can hear everything around you-which is good sometimes like running on a busy street. If you want these to block out any outside noise, look elsewhere, like the Jaybird X3. Other than poor sound isolation, they were great."
3	:	"I love the sound quality, they are incredibly comfortable, they don't put pain in your ears after long uses of them. Perfect for working out and running. The battery life is not the best but is solid. The sad part is the headphones started to malfunction not even 6 months into having them they started turning off and would not turn back on until I manually charged them. Great product, just a shame they didn't last long for how expensive they are. Luckily I bought the 3 year warranty on them."
5	:	"Great head phones, from battery sound to quality I feel so confident.  My biggest dislike is that when on a phone call the persons voice is a bit heavy on bass.  However,  very tolerable.  Coming from the powerbeats these are infinitely more comfortable!mic is very sensitive and people pick up a lot of background sound.Make sure you download the app too!  Very helpful.  Would definitely buy over majority head phones on the market. ESPECIALLY if you want to do some physical activity with them!"
5	:	Excellent product with typical rich and meaty sound. Very well engineered and designed as suggested by the weight. I do not work out in these so cannot vouch for that feature but they fit perfectly for casual use. Super easy pairing. Phone use is superb.
3	:	"Bose always makes great products but this one lacks the wow factor. The volume is awful. The highest setting is soft.Using these at the gym, they cut out a lot if you are around others with Bluetooth headphones (mainly Beats).Regretfully, I wouldn???t recommend these to anyone. Quality is good but the performance leaves a lot to be desired."
2	:	I have owned many Bose products and love my old headphones.  I bought these to get the wireless Bluetooth connection.  Very disappointed in the sound quality.  I use them not to work out but to be mobile when on the phone.  I don???t think I have ever used them when I didn???t get a static humming at some point while talking on the phone.  It becomes not just annoying but difficult to hear the conversation.When I use them to listen to music or streaming the sound quality sounds hollow.  Kind of like the sound is underwater.  I definitely don???t recommend these and that makes me wonder what happened at Bose.  Did they try these out before deciding they were ship ready?
5	:	"The Bose wireless headphones are amazing, The sound is clear and with incredible depth, whether you are playing Springsteen or Sinatra, You hear all of the instruments individually I had been using the Beats wireless phones but was disappointed with the quality of the sound. I decided to take a chance on the Bose since I enjoy my Bose stereo system which also produces incredible sound in a small package. I had some trouble with the phones which rest on your ears and do not go deep inside the ear canal But once I got the hang of it, the phones were incredibly comfortable and produced truly spectacular sound at high, crisp volume."
4	:	"my first pair of these failed almost immediately. I've had the replacements for several months now. they get heavy use running, walking, and on bike rides. So far the microphone has continued to work well and the sound quality is fantastic. definitely recommend these if you are willing to spend a little extra money to improve your mobile aural experience."
4	:	"These are great headphones for working out! My only stipulation is I would like them to go a little bit louder for when I'm really amped up, but its probably for the best."
5	:	My dad recommended these to me and i can't be happier.  Only mishap was when they arrived the box was empty and amazon customer service was super easy and hospitable and sent a new one right away.  I have small ears and have always had problems with my ears aching after wearing apple earbuds and various others but my ears don't hurt with these.  Love these and couldn't recommend them more.
5	:	"It???s been a few months and I absolutely love these headphones. I wear them at work almost every day. Calls sound great through them. I???ve asked almost everyone how I sounded and they said they didn???t notice I was on headphones. (I wanted to double check because of bad reviews about the mic).While the headphones are quality, the clothes clip exploded randomly. However, after reaching out to customer support, they are sending out a replacement at no cost. I was honestly kind of expecting to just be blown off about it, but they really sought to keep me a happy customer. Can???t say enough good things about them.10/10 would buy again."
1	:	"What happened to Bose???s phenomenal quality? I am a long term Bose fan: 201s, 801s, 901s, AM7, AM10s, QC2s, etc. Never have I had any of their product fail this soon or have a quality level this low. Under non-athletic, moderate use, the volume switch assembly cover on these headphones began to separate and ultimately failed. After only 6 months. My experience may be different from yours but I would suggest you proceed with caution. Sorry Bose, I enjoyed our relationship but it may be time for me to move on to a more contemporary quality oriented manufacturer."
4	:	"Pros:1- Great sound, these headphone has one of the best sound you could find for iem or earbud.2- Comfort, again Bose is clear winner for having comfort, you totally dont feel that they are in your ear3- Bluetooth Connection, range is not good but connection time is lightning fast, even better than W1 chip owner BeatsXCons:1- Battery life, i have also BeatsX, compared to BeatsX battery life is definitely is worse. Yes, you can listen 6 hours but only with 50% volume2- Unbalanced sound, this is the worst thing, that makes you send back and refund money. There is inconsistency between left and right ears. i have been testing this for about 1 month, me and everyone else approved that left ear has lower volume than the right. it makes you irritated. Huge disappointment."
2	:	"DON'T BUY!  Bought this pair and the on/off button broke, then the rubber started coming off within a few months.  Thought it was a fluke, so I bought another pair at the local store.  Same thing happened!  So it's a defect in manufacturing. Contacted Bose, and they only offer a 30 day warranty so I'm out of luck!  I can't be the only one with this problem.  Two pairs, and over $340 down the drain!  Shame on Bose.  I'm Not Happy!"
5	:	Exactly what I was hoping for. Sound is better than some of my wired headphones used on my pixel 2 xl. Bass is good. Fit is comfortable and cancels a decent amount of outside sound.
3	:	I like the ease to use these and they charge really quickly in my car. They stick out a little from my ears (more than others I???ve seen) which as a petite girl I wish they didn???t so much. The sound could also be a little louder for during a good workout. I have a pair of $25 skull candy ones that have better volume but aren???t wireless unfortunately.
4	:	"They???re fantastic. With my Apple 3 watch, I love not having to run with my phone and earbuds hooked up. My only complaint is the small earbuds are too small, and the mediums don???t stay in when running because they???re too big. I have to push them back in before they fall out several times during my runs. Sound quality is amazing. Giving four stars because ear buds don???t stay in when running, which is why I got these. Great price."
2	:	"The sound is spectacular - it's Bose...  But the HRM is useless; at least with zwift. Next to impossible to connect, drops out when it does and gives totally bogus HR readings 90% of the time (too high).  Seems to work better with their own app though. Sorta works with Strava, but still hard to connect and lots of dropouts.  Not sure about accuracy with strava"
1	:	I could not get the left side ear bud to stay in my ear. Very frustrated! I used all the different sized adaptors.
1	:	"Died within 9 months with indoor use only.Prior to that, poor noise isolation, and did not get very loud. Bass was okay. Some connectivity issues but overall okay. Would give 2.5 stars prior to it???s premature death, now definitely 1 star.Update:Received a replacement from Bose that died after 3 months. STAY AWAY."
1	:	"I've had these earphones from Bose for all of 4 months and they're already falling apart. Although I had gone over the reviews and seen the complaints and low ratings, whick make up almost half the customers, I unwittingly failed to heed their caution. I was under the assumption that simple wear and tear could be remedied by careful usage, I use these mainly to listen to music and audiobooks at home and barely ever leave them out of the case. And yet, they are in worse condition than most 30$ earphones I previouly used.  So please learn from my mistake and avoid these earphones completely. And if you must, buy them somewhere that offers warranty (read best buy)."
1	:	"I've modified my review from 5 stars to one. After only a year (purchased 22-nov-2017) the battery lasts one hour only, the buttons the headphone and cable barely work and the rubber housing has detached from both headphones. Unfortunately, they're I need to buy new ones after only a year. Im a Bose fan, but in this case I'm really really disappointed. I don't recommend."
4	:	"The device itself is good. I can't say I've had (CONNECTION TO EDWARD'S IPHONE LOST) (CONNECTION TO EDWARD'S IPAD LOST) too many issues with it (CONNECTED TO EDWARD'S IPHONE) (CONNECTED TO EDWARD'S IPAD) so far. The biggest issues that I have is more just getting used to going from a Bose SoundSport to (CONNECTION TO EDWARD'S IPHONE LOST) this. The ear buds fill in your ear more than the (CONNECTED TO EDWARD'S IPHONE) SoundSport did, so it's harder to hear anything around you (exercisers beware). But over all, good devise! (CONNECTION TO EDWARD'S IPHONE LOST)"
1	:	The sound is great. They fit perfectly even when running in high winds but my I???m on my third pair in three months and they just stopped working yesterday. This time after only three uses. Customer service is great but it???s frustrating to have them stop working. I???ve only worn them in winter months so I???m not sweating much. The longest run I???ve taken them on is less than an hour and half. I don???t trust them for longer runs. My iPod and Bose ear buds (with wires) never fail me. I love Bose products but this is not on par with their other products.
5	:	"These headphones are fantastic. They sound even better than my Bose wired headphones, with great bass and clarity, a nice full sound. The battery life is great, I can easily use throughout the day without charging them. I recommend getting the charging case to go with it, so you can charge when you're on the go. They charge really fast, with a 15 minute charge giving you an hour of listening. No connection problems so far, overall a good product. I would expect nothing less from Bose. Highly recommend buying these!"
5	:	"Got these babies for christmas and I can't seem to take them off my ears. The manual says the charge lasts for 6 hours but I went at least 7 without having to plug in. The sound is incredible, the ear buds are super comfy (and come in three different sizes,) and the control buttons are really easy to use when you have the headphones on (very important for runners/ cardio enthusiasts like me!) I had zero issues connecting to bluetooth with my iPhone 7, which I read was an issue for others."
2	:	"The sound is great.  But surprisingly, for a Bose product-- the battery did NOT hold its charge.  I got it as a Christmas gift from my spouse.... and by mid February, it was no longer working.  And I didn't even use it every day.  The set up with its phone app was a little wierd, too.  Unfortunately, Amazon's policy is full refund return only by January 30.  Well, that doesn't help me if I get a defective product.  Luckily, a nice Amazon person said she will refund the merchandise... but I did not get the full amount.  $111  for a product that cost $130+.  Why should I be penalized when Bose made a defective product?"
5	:	"The package came within two days with free shipping. The power button is kind of hard to press, but it???s probably for a good reason. I can hear more details in my music I couldn???t hear before and I like that they won???t fall out. I came from the wired SoundTrue Ultra version but got tired of the cables getting tangled. This is an amazing wireless alternative. The color also compliments my blue iPhone XR. If you???re thinking of buying this, I would definitely recommend it! ????????"
5	:	"I have similar Bose wired headphones which I love.  I was hesitant about sound quality over Bluetooth.  To my surprise, the sound quality of these headphones is amazing.  Battery life is good and they are durable.  I am very happy with these and may ditch my wired headphones all together."
2	:	"Average  headphones at high price for the quality. Good sound, good noise canceling, everything else is mediocre at best. Really bad microphone, can't use for calls - no one can hear me. Even my iphone default headphones work better.Bad quality overall - after a few month parts start fall apart - on/off button fell."
5	:	Really awesome.. I was trying to find another Bluetooth in ear headset for cheaper but after returning a few I will be keeping this.  Stays in ears comfortably and having no wires is a MASSIVE upgrade.  Wish it weren't so expensive but nevertheless for how much i use my headphones its worth the price i suppose.
1	:	extremely unhappy with this purchase.  I bought these because i really loved their wired headphones.  But these are a terrible design.  During any physical activity (especially running) they immediately fall out of your ears.  The ear piece as well as the chord are too heavy to stay in the ear.  Tried all sizes of ear piece and they still fall out.  Bose lost a customer with these.
1	:	"These were obviously used and returned.  They were out of the bag laying in the box, and they were trying to sync to someone else's cell phone. Very disappointing.  I was embarrassed when my husband opened them as a Christmas gift."
4	:	"I like the sound quality and the fit. I like the freedom of not being attached to my phone. But the battery life isn't that great. After being fully charged, they only last about 5-6 like listening to music when I work and sometimes, I work really long hours.They're still good headphones. But my Skull candy ones have a better battery life."
1	:	Waste of money!  Destroyed after not eve 4 months!  Very disappointed in the products that Bose has been putting out lately!
1	:	"Bought it less than a year and has started falling apart such as the right  earbud. I replaced it with the factory spare earbud and it works fine again. However, I went running today with fully charge dand I heard 30% left after 20 mins run. It dropped to zero instantly after a short 5 mins phone call. Tried to charge it but the orange only blinked for few seconds and the right side started heating up, so I unplugged it immediately. This is a safety issue, Bose should keep an eye on that. I will contact my local Bose support tomorrow."
5	:	"I absolutely love these headphones. They are super easy to use, fit my ears better than any other in-ear headphones I've ever tried, and stay securely in place regardless of what I'm doing.  The small clip on the cord is a nice touch and serves to keep the cord from bouncing and pulling on the headphones while they are in my ear.  The sound quality is precisely what you would expect from a Bose product, and the ability to hear things in my vicinity provides a level of situational awareness not often found in other products I've tried.  These are perfect for running, biking, or just a trip to the gym."
5	:	"Over the past several years I've been in search of the nirvana wireless headphones. I'm just a headphone junky.. Currently own Airpods which I like a lot except they come loose and lose their seal pretty easily so I constantly need to fidget with them. I also like my Beats Studio Wireless units for an over ear experience. In terms of wireless earbuds, I've had Jaybird Freedoms various Sony units, I've had Beats Including Powerbeats3 and BeatsX. None of them gave me a satisfying experience. There was always the shortfall of the cord tugging the ear piece out of your ear, volume level not being adequate for my taste, and the ultimate deal breakers being fit/comfort and sound quality. They all fell short and were returned with a sense of disappointment. Then came the Bose Soundsport. I've had them for a couple of days and I can't stop using them. Sound is really good for bluetooth. Sound stage is very crisp and clear with very little perceived distortion. Bass is very nice. Sound is very clean, very tight even at higher volume levels. The fit is the best of any units I've ever tested. Comfort level allows for hours of listening without any fatigue what so ever. Never had any issues with ear pieces coming lose during movement or exercise/walks,etc. I use the collar clip and the wire is never an issue. Its like its not even there. I get a great seal with the large tip for my ear. Minimal outside sound gets through which sort of surprised me given the other reviews that I have read about the units not giving a good seal. Volume level is very adequate. Sound quality is so good you don't need to push them to the limit to get robust sound experience. Also, while walking outside with these units I didn't suffer any dropouts which has been a common problem with other units I have had. Phone call quality is also very good. I got no complaints when making calls while driving on expressway with high level of highway noise. The units are pretty big and look a bit ugly so that is a bit of a detractor for some but the stability and comfort of these things is incredible! I've never owned a Bose product before and now I'm a convert. These guys obviously pay attention to every detail when they design a product with major emphasis on sound quality and fit/comfort."
2	:	"While the sound quality is good, the battery life is awful. I???ve had these headphones for 6 weeks and I cannot get a full charge out of them. I charged all night and got to 90%. I did a 2 hour workout wearing them, threw them in my gym bag, tried to turn them on the next day and they were completely drained of battery. Plugged them in for 24 hours, got an 80% charge. Ridiculous for the amount spent on them."
4	:	"Everything about these headphones is great, the battery life, ease of use, comfort, quality. However, the sound isn't what I expected from Bose, especially for $150. Don't get me wrong it is good, but definitely not great. Our family has had a few Bose entertainment systems over the years, and judging from my experience with those I expected a lot more. Audio quality is good, but the range is kind of stuck in a balanced middle area. The bass isn't strong, and the treble is a bit flat."
1	:	I was so excited to get these. Have been looking for good quality wireless headphones for my workouts. It for well and sound quality was decent. However after my 3rd time using these the battery died in the middle of my workout even though it was fully charged and now it won???t charge at all. Completely dead. Returning.
4	:	"...not so good for phone calls. I got these because they stay in my ear really well when I'm at the gym. Sound quality is excellent. They come with a microphone for phone calls, but it picks up everything in the room--no sound canceling at all. The phone itself does a really good job at suppressing ambient noise, but when you're using the Bluetooth headphones, it's completely bypassed."
1	:	"I bought mine in May, they stopped working in August, or should I say DIED in August. What good is a two year warranty when you have to go through the hassle of finding the box, etc, you know what I???m talking about. Also, the charge time is about 4-5 hours, far less than advertised. Some will say I have a ???lemon???. Fine, when you get your lemon, we won???t be making lemonade. I???ll be buying another brand."
1	:	"I was a big fan of Bose products and I was hoping these headphones would be good quality. The sound is great and they are also very comfortable but the battery life is very poor. I have not used them that much, probably less than 50 times in 6 months and the battery life is only about 20 minutes which makes that product pretty useless and very poor quality. I would not recommend that product."
4	:	"Awesome sound - what else would you expect from a Bose. Call quality is good, received compliments on voice clarity. Great fit, there is no fatigue. The only gripe? 6 hours or less battery life. That's the only disappointing factor."
5	:	"We own other Bose products and have always been very happy with the sound quality. These headphones produce a nice, natural sound without excess bass boom that muddies the music. There's plenty of bass for the tracks that have it, but it doesn't overwhelm, which is great for being able to hear music the way it was meant to be heard. Noise isolation is excellent. I use these daily on my commute on the train."
5	:	I researched for the best Bluetooth earbuds and bought another pair that was highly rated.  I like Bose products but based on the reviews decided to go against my better judgement.  Got them and decided to purchase the Bose Soundsport Pulse.  Should have struck with Bose  they are great.  I have a Garmin Fenix 5 Plus  activity watch with music.  They connected via Bluetooth perfectly and sound as good as any headphones I have.  I also pair them with my phone and my laptop and in all cases the Bluetooth connection is perfect and again the sound is awesome.
3	:	"BUYER BEWARE. Bought these in June 2017, and they weren???t cheap so I expect them to work as advertised. On my second pair. Sound is good but battery life is left to be desired. Only lasts 6 hrs, not even a full work day. As time goes on battery seems very spotty. Plugged in to charge for three hrs and only charged to 20%, happening randomly as of late. This is how the decline starts, sure I???ll be on my third pair in no time..."
2	:	"stays in ear good. Good sound BUT the thing is like 8 months old and I can tell the battery isn't holding the charge like it did when new. When I first got it, the charge held for 4 workout and now its holding for 2-3 workouts. Darn shame when it cost as much money as it does. My next pair will be a different brand. Once burned, twice shy"
5	:	"These are the best head phones I have ever had. They are comfortable to keep in for hours and without the cord they allow you to move more freely. I use them working out, during yard work, in bed at night, and running. They never fall out and have amazing sound quality. I highly recommend these to anyone that is tired of the cords."
5	:	"These are the best ear buds I have owned.  If placed correctly into your ears (follow directions) they will not come out easily.  I have many,many ear buds in my home that I have wasted money on looking for the right fit.  I would by them again.  Sound is exceptional!"
5	:	"I've used these for about six weeks now and I really like them.  They're comfortable, and even at the gym they don't fall out or need repositioning.  The sound is excellent.  Obviously, the battery is tiny but the headphones seem to use about 10%-12% per hour from fully charged and they recharge quickly.  Here's hoping that they hold up over time."
5	:	"i bought one last Sept and been using it for running and working out.  The sound is great compare to other Bluetooth headphones so far.  The fit is ok, don't know why one of earbud keep falling out while the other ear has no problem.  Even with one of the earbud keep popping out my ear CONSTANTLY while i was running, i still love the headphone cuz of the rich sound that it produce.  Til recently it is having trouble connecting to my iPhone and i don't know why.  I called Bose service about this and they said its still under warranty and let me exchange for a brand new headphone.  Love the assurance!"
2	:	"Liked the fit and the sound, until..... I played a couple of mellow songs from Gorillaz- Humanz album, Busted and Blue and from Thom Yorke's new solo album Tomorrow's Modern Boxes, Interference; both songs had static near the high tones and in sound gaps.  I have these paired with an I phone 6, and was standing next to my phone when the static was heard. Except for the static the sound was good.  Also, I thought I was buying a new product, what I received was a product that was used as it had been paired with another persons I phone, repackaged and sent to me. I have returned for a new replacement . I will submit a follow up review on the static and how the feel and fit during a workout."
5	:	"I have been looking for a decent pair of earphones for years.  The sound is truely amazing.  Sounds like the club is in my ears.  Very easy to connect and disconnect.  Easy to charge and very long lasting battery.  I also purchased the charging case, which is a great pairing.  The bluetooth range is better than my mini bose speaker.  Stays in my ears while running and spinning.  Handles sweat really well without falling out.  The clip on the back holds to the shirt good."
5	:	"The wireless headphones are perfect for me.  The eye buds are so comfortable, but do make sure you put them in correctly or the won???t feel good.  I had to play around a little to get it right, but once you do it???s perfect.  I love to walk around while on the phone, or continue to do housework, grade school papers and even walk and work out with these in place all while listening to my favorite music.  The earbuds totally stay in place.  My husband has a set also and he does have a problem with sweating into his ears.  He really works out hard and sweats a lot so this may affect others also but not me."
4	:	"Got this for exercise for myself and these do the trick! Great sound, and sweat proof. Would not suggest these to someone who wants to listen to music and just sit around, while the sound quality is good, it is not great and there are better headphones which aren't sweatproof for this price. But this is exactly what I needed."
2	:	"GREAT sound quality.  LOUSY battery life.  Very disappointed:  I returned the first pair as they would not hold a charge, and after a short while simply stopped working/wouldn't take a charge...just DEAD.  Repurchased the exact item as I am so pleased with the sound quality.  Unfortunately, though, the charge doesn't last long at all.  In addition, I let the charge run completely down today, plugged them into the charger, and 30 seconds into the charge, the GREEN (full-charge) light came on.  How is that possible?Summary...while I like Bose, love the sound quality on this product, I feel like they have taken my money for a shoddy product because I've had troubles with BOTH pair that I've purchased."
2	:	battery problems and software problems. Charge for overnight. Down to 20% by the next morningGreat.  good sound quality and they are the only headphones known to man that fits my girlfriends miniscule ears.let in like 30% ambient sound... wish it were a bit more so that I could feel safe using them on my bicycle.
5	:	"This is my second pair of these headphones and they are excellent, the last pair lasted almost from release to about 3 months ago due to one of the earpieces going out. I sweat a lot when I work out and these headphones lasted longer and were of higher quality (Both sound and build) than any other pair I've owned. Bose has essentially gained a customer??? for life."
1	:	"Come oon, My headphone's sound is epic! but what I got is total crap. For over $100 headphone I expect nothing perfect such hyperx cloud2's perfomance. But this thing's connection interrupts or stutters per 10-15seconds. I don't know whether I've get defective unit or no. But to me getting this expensive headphone and deliving via 3rd party to 3rd world country such as Mongolia is very SAD (it took me almost 2-3 weeks) to get it. And then the device plays 10seconds and stutters. My phone is nexus 5x."
3	:	I like the product except there is a ton of error with my product. I charge the unit well over 5 hours at times and it now only charges up to 90%. my battery life wont even last through a complete gym workout for me. I have to charge the product for longer than I even use it. I'm actually getting really frustrated with it. When I get a low battery notification It keeps going reminding me without any way for me to turn it off. I also wish that I am able to still hear my sound when the unit is connecting or reminding me my battery life. It would be nice if it played over my music instead of muting all noise except for the unit.
5	:	These have seen some heavy use since I purchased them three months ago. Daily use for 6-8 hours a day hasn't caused any trouble with these other than the loss of 3 of the small clothing clips. The headphones themselves work great and the clip can be replaced for a couple dollars from the Bose website.
3	:	"I absolutely love the sound that these put out, problem is about 2 weeks ago they started to not charge, and now I have an amazing sounding pair of headphones that don't work. These have been taken very good care of I do not expose them to the outdoors at all, they are just dead. 110 for the used ones, like new for 4 months, not even heavy enough to be a paperweight. Shame..."
3	:	Have been using it for little more than a year - its falling apart now . Poor build quality seems to be more like Bose has planned it to start degrading by 1 year of use . The controls rubber flap is coming off and the Bose logo around the ears fell too. for $150 its quite average . I got almost similar working duration with a cheap Chinese model !
1	:	"Not enough noise isolation. No good for bicycle riding, walking or running with traffic, or anything on subways, busses, or airplanes... any place there's more than a little noise.Sound quality is only average. I expected better from Bose.The app really doesn't do anything."
5	:	"These headphones have made my workouts sooooo much more pleasant. Now that I've had a taste of what working out without strings attached feels like, I'm never going back! A full charge gets me through about 3 workouts (2 hours each) and the sound quality is pretty nice! Many say it has better sound quality than the wireless Beats but I can't corroborate this information myself since I've never tried those."
1	:	"These headphones stopped taking a charge within 6 months of purchase. After contacting Bose directly about this problem (a common one after doing some Google troubleshooting), they offered to replace them. However, we were required to have the case and the extra foam fittings. These weren't something that we kept, so they refused to honor the warranty.  Will not buy Bose again with such poor quality and customer service."
1	:	Initially I loved these. The sound quality is great. I have been a loyal Bose user since 2010. This will probably be my last Bose purchase. I have had these for a year and they are already falling apart. Very disappointed. For the price I feel they should last longer. I keep them in a case when I???m not using them so it???s not from being rough on them.
3	:	"I???m writing his review after one year if useSound is good, fits nicely, holds battery charge for few days ..The rubber elements are expanding and detaching from the hard plastic ones, so not sure if it???s still weather and sweat proof .. I donno what the heck is this type of rubber they use nowadays.. I had the same issue with fitbit bands"
3	:	"Decent sound quality,  not quite as good as the wired ones but better than airpods from apple. Too bulky in your ears and tend to fall out when excersizing.3 stars for poor call quality: the microphone picks up a lot of background and parasitic noise just from moving around indoors,  forget about outdoors and wind. This is where Apple is much better."
5	:	"Great headphones that were better than I expected.  Comfortable fit and great sound.  Battery life could be longer, but a not a big issue for me using them at work.  Amazon customer service, however, gets zero stars.  I had a minor issue, and the more I tried to explain it, the more they didn't get it and just repeated themselves until I was too frustrated to deal with it.  I would have returned them and re-bought them elsewhere if they weren't going to charge me for it.  Any large purchases in the future will be done through the manufacturer or a physical store.  I'm not one to hold a grudge, but I'm still salty about it."
5	:	"Clear deep bass and clear overall sound. The only thing I would say is they are not as loud as Powerbeats2, but these Bose Soundsport are much better sound quality. The app is awesome when needing specific information or find my headphones. For the price I bought them for, I'd get these any day over the powerbeats."
2	:	"I have purchased 3 headsets from Bose and one Mini Sound Link. All have failed, or the battery life has been reduced so far to make them unusable. The battery life on this headset started fading after a few months. This is the same issue I had with Bose previous headsets. Nine months in and fully charge the headset lasts about 30 minutes. The Mini Sound Link continually disconnects from WI FI and I have called Bose support several times and they can't fix it. I bought an expensive in ear phone ear piece that guaranteed 6 hours of talk time. 6 months in and the charge lasts about 15 minutes. I will NEVER buy a BOSE product again....!"
5	:	"Great sound, pretty decent battery life, and they have stayed in place during runs/workouts.  My only  minor gripe is that the wire pulls out of the little clip (which can be used to clip excess cord to your shirt to keep the wire from bouncing around your neck) pretty easily.  Luckily,  I have not experienced the cord bouncing around or otherwise annoying me, even while running. But I find the clip to be almost useless. I really don't think it's needed anyway."
4	:	"I love these headphones. Perfect for the gym. At first I thought these were going to be a bit challenging to insert into my ears but no, surprisingly very simple and also the battery last for days. My workouts go for a hour and a half if I have a full 100% battery it drains 20% so every 4 days I charge them."
4	:	"Best bass of the 3 I tried (Bose, JLab Epic2, Powerbeats3), but it would never stay settled in my left ear correctly. They are pretty bulky, too. I ultimately chose the Powerbeats3 because the Powerbeats were simply louder. These Bose didn't get loud enough, although they generated superb sound."
1	:	"Got these in April.  it is now November and they just gave out.  Lost sound in the middle of use.  Won't turn off, won't turn on, fully charged.  This is not the first time I have bought these and had the same problem.  I was told there was a bug fix so I trusted and bought again.  Unfortunately I am having the same problem."
5	:	"These headphones are awesome! I can usually squeeze four 90 minute workouts out of a single charge.  They're very comfortable.  The sound quality is ridiculous, especially for sport headphones.  They're a little pricey, but you get what you pay for. I won't be buying anything else other than Bose headphones for the gym in the future."
4	:	"LOVE THESE HEADPHONES! My only complaint is battery life - I use them all day, every day, and they make it up until I get home from work, then I have to recharge. I have been told the sound from the microphone is crystal clear by the people I talk to on the phone and it does not pick up any outside interference."
4	:	"Fits great and doesn't block the outside sound complete, so they are great for running, hear good quality music but still be aware of your surroundings."
4	:	"Solid pair of headphones. I use them for around 12 hours a week for both work and working out and they seem to be holding up well to sweat and standard use. From reading some of the negative reviews, I am convinced that the people who are having issues with them either misuse or mistreat the product - while they are great for working out they are still a delicate piece of hardware and should be treated as such.My only complaint is they do not get as loud as I would prefer, but I am sure that is for the protection of my own ears."
5	:	great sound of course!!  I like these having the wire so I don't feel like I'm going to drop and or lose them and can just let them hang on my neck if not in use. I love the little carrying pouch it comes with which is small and fits perfect in a pocket or even small purse or can hook to bag etc.
2	:	"Really wanted to like these but I just cannot give them a good review for one primary reason - they fall out of my ears very easily regardless of which ear adapter I use (tried all three).  I would also add that the large footprint of these on either side of your head makes you look like a goof.  Sound quality, although good is not measurably better than a $39 set.  Bluetooth connectivity and the Bose app are both stellar but does not justify the lofty price given the design flaws.  Since sport earbuds tend to fail pretty easily, it would be hard to recommend these at this price.Update:  Received a refund and purchased a $35 set of no-name earbuds with hooks.  Sound just as good as the Bose and never fall off.  You really do not need to spend over $50 to get a good set.  Even if these cheapies only last a year, it is better than having a $130 set that only last a year."
1	:	"Bought these in June 2017. These work great for a few months then the unit fails to charge - have tried multiple charging methods - the amber charging light always comes on but it fails to deliver, nor does the bluetooth light appear. This is the 2nd time I have experienced this with Bose SoundSport which suggest a serious flaw in usually dependable Bose quality.Destined to go through all the hassle once again for an exchange given it's too late to return to Amazon.Seriously Fed Up Bose consumer"
5	:	"Best wireless headphone ever. Fit perfectly and solidly into the ears. Take into account the headphones protrudes somewhat from the ear but I guess the device must accommodate the electronics. Bluetooth is easily set, connects & works flawlessly with multiple devices.The quality of the sound is superb for this size device. Sound source responds flawlessly to the control and the mic picks up the voice very clearly. I was told that I never sounded so clear.I love it."
4	:	Great sound quality and pretty good a canceling out noise. It also syncs with my iPhone instanaiously as soon as I turn them on. Only complaints I have is I wish it could go louder and the rubber lining buy the power button is starting to come off after a 6 months also they seem to get dirty easily and hard to clean but this would not be an issue with the other colors available.
5	:	Great quality as we expect from Bose. Great sound ear pieces fit well. I like these over the buds without cords bc I am constantly moving  and working out in them. The cord helps catch them when they fall out of my ears.
5	:	Bose is simply the best sound system in the world and that goes w out saying . But this specific headphones are AMAZING. They charge fast . The battery lasts 8 hours. The way the buds fit in the ear blocks all outside noise and give u the best sound available . I work out with them. Work with them. They take a beating and still work like day one
1	:	"They don't hold a charge at all. I'll let them charge until the LED indicates they're fully charged, yet as soon as I turn them on, they're at 90%. An hour later, they're at 50%. They spend more time plugged in and charging than they do in my ears because the battery drains so quickly. Ridiculous."
5	:	"best wireless headphones!!!!I've been using these for almost a year now after they updated it again because of the water issue.I sweat alot, do alot of cardio, resistance training, rowing, etc. I was one of the first people at the gym to have them.Now, I see them everywhere. The connection range is insane too. I leave it next to my gym bag and fill up my water about 50+ feet away and I still have a strong signal. I only have some issues with a slight break in connection sometime when my friend has his phone right next to mine. He has the soundsport too but this rarely happens.These are NOT waterproof but water resistant. You cannot swim in these. I've taken them in the steam sauna with no issues however.Good battery life. I end up leaving the charge cable in my car connected to the cig outlet and I charge them after every use just in case.Overall great sound quality for wireless headphones that stay in your ear."
4	:	"I really lived these earphones. However, customer service is AWFUL. Bought the earphones in November 2016. They stopped working in May 2017, won???t even turn on. I have been back and forth with customer service since then (we???re up to Oct 24 here) trying to get them to do something about it. It is awful. And a shame. It has really ruined the buying experience for me. I really liked Bose products prior to this. A great warranty is only good if the company will actually execute it."
4	:	"This is a good product that falls just short of great. I purchased these because the most accessible type of earbuds constantly fall out of my ears. I must be one of the rare cases because everyone else seems to be able to keep theirs in their ears. The Bose SoundSports eliminates my problem completely. I could probably hang upside down without them falling out.The sound quality is pretty good, although the highs aren't pristine enough for the price tag. The bass is impressive though, very punchy for not being over-the-ear headphones.The SoundSports are overpriced by at least $20, if not $30."
4	:	"Great sound and battery life. Took off one star because I don't know if I like the way they at in my ears. One ear piece sits snug, while the other states to move around when working out. But like I said, great sound and product from Bose."
2	:	"Sound and bluetooth worka great! BUT the greatest flaw... the ear piece is weird and uncomfortable. I own the regular ones and they fit perfectly, but this sports one is uncomfortable and keeps popping out!"
5	:	"I love the headphones, I am not an audiophile so those of you who can hear the subtle differences in headphones might not agree. However to me the sound is full with great bass. My only complaint is the clip that comes with it to hold the cord in place. It pops off easily and if you do not notice it at the time it happens it will get lost like mine did"
2	:	"They worked great when I first got them but after about 6 months they started to fall apart.  First the clip broke, then the plastic end caps became lose.  Now the Bluetooth drops, and the range is getting worse.  I would say 4/5 for the first 6 months then 2/5 when it starts to breakdown."
3	:	"Love the sound of these headphones but they are constantly falling out. You get three size options Ginormous, huge and big. My ears are not small but the smallest size of buds included is too big. It's a pity, I'm a big fan of Bose products but I'm a little disappointed with the sizing of these headphones."
5	:	"Best headphones I've owned, period. I've wasted time and money on Skullcandy and such, but once I dropped the cash for Bose, I dropped all the others.Great company, great sound, great fit.  You can't go wrong with the SoundSport."
5	:	"Can't say enough about these excellent headphones and mic.  Music sounds great, even in windy situations, and the mic picks up voice perfectly for phone calls. Good single, double and triple-click control.  Quick to blue-tooth connect and release the control each time with a Google Pixel - nice work engineers at Bose!"
1	:	Whats the deal with the extremely low sound on these headphones. Bose is supposed to be powerful these are awful I do not recommend them especially for the price tag. UPDATE: Sound is still very low and on top of that the battery life only lasts 1.5 to 2 hours tops on a full charge. Do not waste your money on these!
4	:	"UPDATE II:After complaining to the Amazon's Customer Service, my headphones are being replaced by Amazon. Five stars for Amazon, but I am getting one star of my original 5-star ratings for the headphones, since they should have lasted more than a year of very moderate use.UPDATE I:I have enjoyed the buds for almost a year (I bought them on 10/16/16) running 2-3 times a week for 1-2 hours. Unfortunately, over the last two weeks the volume went down to a very low level and it's impossible to make it higher (beeps indicating the upper limit). I updated the firmware and verified the problem with several devices that do work fine with other headphones.For $150 I would expect something that lasts longer, so I would like to exchange them for a working set. Unfortunately again, bose.com will accept neither returns nor exchanges for products bought from other sellers. I bought from Amazon, but Amazon's product support page links to bose.com.The comfort and the sound quality were great, but I am not satisfied with the length of service at this price range. I have several other upper end headphones (including Bose QC 20i) that have served well for years justifying the high prices.ORIGINAL:The sound is great!I own several Bose headphones, but I tried a few cheaper options before just giving up and going back to Bose.They are a bit bulky, but stay in my ears while running (long distance). I love Bose design as there is no pressure change inside the ear. Other models that I tried just created modulating waves for the sound.There is only one other brand that I found with this design, but sound-wise it was complete junk. Others had decent sound (nothing like Bose though!), but the thumping and the modulation was unbearable. I also got some kind of inflammation from in-ear designs as they rub the interior of the ear for several hours.Nothing like that with Bose, so I highly recommend them. I also use QCi2.0 - excellent for air travel."
5	:	"Music awesome in these, and if you cell phone volume doesn't go loud enough remember to use the volume button on the cord. TH\his is where I think most forget to check and you can drain noise out if wanted to. This also works for those needing to head vehicles or surroundings at night for safety purposes."
2	:	"I've been using the wired version of these for a couple of years and have been extremely happy with them.  For this pair I decided to go wireless for the obvious advantages.  Overall, however, I am rather disappointed with the wireless version.  First, the redesigned ""Stay Hear"" ear pieces seal much better than the previous design and are better at blocking external noise, but this come with the side effect picking up 'internal' noise (e.g. chewing noises when listening to music or watching a movie while eating) and distorting the sound of ones own voice when on a call.  It's a bit like having your head underwater. Secondly, they are really big, so big that my stocking cap doesn't fit well with the headphones on. Third, after about an hour of use I begin to feel general discomfort in my ears.  Fourth, as others have mentioned, the maximum volume is significantly lower than the wired version. And fifth, they are bass-dominant, which may be great for some music, but not so much for podcasts or streaming news."
4	:	"I don't know what everyone is fussing about, they sound just as loud and just as good as the wired bose, which I think are the best sounding earphones (earbuds what ever you want to call them). The only reason it gets 4 stars is because the volume rocker strip is not as easy to press down on, it's stiff. I know the original versions were defective but these new ones are just fine. They stay in the ear just fine, I did an hour of Cardio and they didn't move. The Jaybird's X2 I have and I absolutely hate not being able to hear my surrounding area and they fall out of my ear (they sound okay though). Anyway, I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars ****"
2	:	"I have always wanted to buy a Bose product after hearing all bose speakers in all the stores out there. Not being able to sample these headphones in store made it a little difficult to decide if I wanted to buy them. I thought, 'they're Bose so they must be the best of the best. Well I've had mine for 3 months and although the sound is pretty good, the most annoying thing is the battery. I will charge it and the light turns green indicating it's fully charged and when I turn it on it is only 60%. So you guesed it, they don't last very long in that charge. I can't get but maybe 3 hours and they die.That and as you can see in the picture below the sleeve already is falling apart and sliding down.I would have expected after paying $150 for ""Bose"" headphones that I would get a decent product. I'm sadly disappointed."
1	:	Started popping in one ear because of sweat I guess after a couple times at gym. Really disappointed in these.
5	:	"This is my first bluetooth/wireless headphones purchase and I am absolutely pleased with this. Ear pieces fit perfectly, sound quality is great, when you turn on the headphones, it notifies you at what percentage the battery is. Love this product, highly recommend!"
4	:	"Comfortable, secure, great Bose sound, easy to pair, and water-resistant. They've endured sweat and rain, and not missed a beat. I've gone through two Jaybird Bluebuds X Bluetooth Headphones and both died from moisture right after warranty expired.  These are not the most inconspicuous headphones out there though, so if you're looking for that you should move on...they protrude from your ear quite a bit."
2	:	"The sound from these were great. They were comfortable, the battery lasted all day. The in call Mic was also great. My problem is that they fell apart. This was my second pair of these to do this. The first pair I blamed on the heat from leaving them in my car when I went into the store one day. This second pair has not left my office. The rubber piece that is used for the volume control has popped up out of the inline volume control and won't go back in. The rubber along the right ear bud has started to warp and come up from around the ear bud. I can't blame this on the heat.For $150 I wish these would have had better longevity. This last pair hasn't even made it 6 months."
5	:	Used it for the first time today.  Awesome!  I have very small ears and was worried the smallest buds would be too big but they held up just fine over a 40 minute hard run.  I'm tired of buying cheap phones and being disappointed so I went pricey with Bose.  I am NOT disappointed.
1	:	Right from the start never could get the battery up to 100%. Got maybe 4 hours at the start. 3 months in 3 hours. 6 months lucky to get 2 hours with the last 20 minutes hearing the warning that the battery is low.Everything else is great which is all lost because of the battery. Worst Bose product I have purchased. I've bought nothing but Bose for wired earbuds. Thought this was a no brainer. It was a brainer.
2	:	"Audio quality was good, not mind-blowing, not particularly bassyFit was loose and didn't feel secure in the ear. This also hurt the quality because of lots of outside noise penetrationBulky and outdated designGood connectivity and battery life though"
5	:	"I really like these headphones.  The fit and size of these are great!  I was worried about them being huge, but they are not.  I was expecting them to protrude out from my head, but the size of them in your ear is not bad at all.  I can still wear my knit hat over my ears with them in without a problem.  You wouldn't even know I had on headphones if it weren't for the cord.  They stay in place very well.  I tried moving/jerking my head to see if they would come loose and they didn't.  I wore them for a couple of hours without pain.  Very comfortable in your ears.The sound on these is amazing!  They make everything sound good!  You don't even need the app like you do for the Jaybird X3s.  So, I don't see the benefit of the app.  I think I'm going to delete it.I got these because I've been trying to find some wireless headphones that I can use when I go biking.  I usually encounter a problem when I stick my phone in my bike jersey pocket or my coat pocket when it's colder out.  Other headphones that I had would stop playing or wouldn't work.  I also had problems once I started riding because of the wind.  Well, I had no such problems with these!  I popped them in, used the voice command to get my music playing and that was it!  I stuffed my phone in my jacket pocket and they played without a hitch!  I tried that with the X3s and the headphones immediately disconnected.  Not these babies!  They just kept playing and it was crystal clear.  I thought the wind from me riding would be a problem, boy was I wrong.  I rode with these for about an hour and a half and no problems.  These aren't noise cancelling so, yes, you can still hear the cars and folks around you without a problem (No, I wasn't blasting the music)!  They stayed in place, even as I turned my head to check for traffic. They just stayed put and kept cranking out crystal clear sounds!  Being able to use these while I ride was the clincher for me!  I've owned Bose products in the past and they haven't disappointed me yet.  A big thumbs up Bose!Pros:Great FitVery comfortableSuper easy to pairGreat sound (music and phone calls)Great for bikingGreat connection with your deviceCons:App (not necessary)battery life (I need to confirm that I can get the six hours, that's still not great)"
5	:	"I walk the dog everyday; these are great for not blocking out all the outside noise while delivering great sound. Over the ear options just make you an easy target for anyone who might wanna surprise you. The come with three in-ear size pieces for a better fit. I'm fairly sensitive to hard plastic in-ear headphones (Apple), they hurt after a little while. These, are, awesome. Spendy, but I do believe you get what you pay for. A quality experience all around."
5	:	These are great sounding headphones! I didn???t end up keeping them because of how much they pertrude out of my ears. But other than that they are great. They have that classic Bose sound. Not as crisp Highs as the Jaybirds but a very well balanced sound.
2	:	"Two stars because while they lasted, I loved the sound and comfort. Unfortunately, six months in to ownership and they failed. the battery is good but the sound comes distorted and uneven. Will not buy again. Also, read other reviews and it looks like quality control is no longer priority for Bose. Sad!"
1	:	"So I really wanted to love these, unfortunately regardless of which ear clips I used they simply wouldnt stay in my ears. In addition, the controls are so clunky and spongy, had a hard time getting it to respond. Bummer, I really wanted to love this product."
5	:	"Great sound, decent battery, decent microphone. But once I find a truly cordless replacement, I'll probably go for that instead, but so far I've been disappointed by those offering, and I settled on these instead.No water resistance. Remote can't go to previous/next song."
1	:	Battery is rated for up to 6 hours.  In my experience it was more like 3.5 hours max.
1	:	"These broke down within a year of me using them.  All of a sudden, they wouldn't turn on.  After many attempts of troubleshooting, I returned them and received a replacement which was also defective! It only had sound from one earbud!! Extremely disappointed with the brand which is typically rated highly for the quality of their products.  I loved these while they worked because they were extremely comfortable...just wish the quality was better and lasted long enough for them to be worth the $99 I paid!  The battery also died very quickly."
5	:	"Bought these as a gift to my husband before we went on vacation. They pack easy and hold their charge well, which was a relief when we spent over 20 hrs getting to our destination. He uses them all the time! His only complaint is how much they stick out of the ear."
1	:	"I am stunned by how this is slipping by Bose. The mic on these things is SO sensitive, they are basically unusable for calls. Not a good situation for headphones this expensive; they should be all-in-one. No options to change the sensitivity on the mic, either. I would be in the living room, and people could hear my roommate chopping vegetables in the kitchen. Calls were impossible. Once I started googling in-depth, found out this was a common issue that Bose hasn't addressed. Returned and happily got myself the Jabras."
1	:	"The First time I purchased this item, after 2-3 weeks it just abrubtly stopped working. After Amazon was very helpful in exchanging for a another, after 4 days or so, it just started turning off while in use. Horrible product by a reputable company."
4	:	"These are great for working out because they let ambient sound through so you can hear your music but still hear traffic if you're out running. Audio quality is okay but honestly I think it just takes getting used to the non isolating design. Really comfortable in ears, though"
2	:	"When I initially used these headphones, they were phenomenal. But now they are completely dead. They charge but upon powering on, they simply die. I believe this may be due to internal software or hardware issues. I intend to return these. Very disappointing considering how Bose as a company is highly reputed in the audio industry."
1	:	"The sound is relatively Low as compare to apple earphone which we get with I phone, most disappointing is battery performance. The battery doesn???t last long also it took too much time to fully charge. I charged for 3+ hours when I connect to my iPhone the battery was only 30%.I was very disappointed with this purchase returned it back.Thanks for return service provided by Amazon."
5	:	I just bought them and they got my ear just fine.1. Download app first.2. Should sync via Bluetooth quickly.3. Control volume on phone and on control on cord.Cons: none so far1. Not noise cancelling but great sound
5	:	"These earbuds have incredible quality and clarity with long battery life and impressive BT range, for when you walk away from your phone in the other room. The earpieces are comfortable through extended wear. Would highly recommend!"
5	:	"I got these for my husband as a gift. He uses them every day and raves about how great the sound quality is, how comfortable they are, and easy they are to use. He is a picky buyer and would not say that if the product was anything less than outstanding. I highly recommend these!"
5	:	"Not only do they sound amazing like all of Bose products, but they managed to surprise me by being able to sync to two devices simultaneously.  When I have my phone and my laptop out, I can pause music on the phone and start a Youtube video on the laptop, and the SoundSports conveniently switch devices seamlessly.  Bose has outdone themselves again!"
4	:	"I am a fan of the Bose products.  I purchased these primarily for use at the gym.  In that regard,  they are great.  Only real complain i have is the sound quality, while not bad, is not any better or worse than much cheaper pairs i have owned.  Therefore, i give it 4 stars due to price point.  Otherwise,  a solid pair of headphones."
3	:	"When they work, they worked great. I almost gave 4 stars for that. But as time went on (I owned them for only 13 months), they worked less and less. There would be occasional stoppage issues, and increasing disconnect from the Bluetooth that required forgetting the headphones, turning off the Bluetooth, turning the Bluetooth back on, and then re-pairing. I could live with those issues because they were sporadic, but finally, right at about the 13 month mark, the headphones began to just physically fall apart so that now I can???t even turn music on and off or change the volume with the headphones. Inexcusable for $150 headphones"
4	:	"Excellent sound quality. (I work in pro audio, so this matters most to me.) Very functional. I knocked off one star because none of the inserts are a perfect fit for my ears. Still going back and forth between sizes trying to find the best fit. Overall, very happy with these buds."
1	:	"Bought these to replace Jaybird X Sport headphones that were a couple of years old and finally stopped working... Compared Bose to the new version of the Jaybird, and sound of the Bose is better, no doubt.  So, returned the Jaybirds and kept the Bose.  But found they will not hold a charge.  Twice after being fully charged and ""100% battery"" reported, I would use them for 40 -60 minutes and then turn the off.  When I went to use them a few days later, NO CHARGE AT ALL.  My old Jaybirds held a charge for a few weeks easily.  I know Bose sells a charging case, but I really don't think you should have to keep charging them at all times.  After reading some of the prior 1 star reviews, I decided best to return during the 30 day period in which Amazon will accept them back.  Not taking a chance.  Too bad, because good sound and fit.  Reordered the Jaybirds..."
1	:	"Received in early December and used for approximately one month. Is in great condition, did not fall apart like the other reviews claimed, however, just stopped working. Used during exercise, I moderately sweat so for it to quit because of sweat would be extremely disappointing as this is advertised as Sport headphones. Had a pair of Bose sports headphones in past and they lasted more than 2 years with lots of wear on them. Why I purchased these. Extremely disappointed in a Bose product being so poorly developed."
5	:	"Sound is great!  It sync up to my Iphone very quickly.  So far the battery life is great!  Out of the package the ear buds looked way to big, but they fit well and hold during heavy workouts"
5	:	"I love listening to music on these they are so much better than normal ear buds.I could not pair these with my laptops when I had windows 7 installed, but on machines that I was running win 8.1 and win 10 on, they were able to connect. Keep in mind that if you want to use the mic while bluetoothed to your laptop, the sound will be in mono. You get to select a device depending on if you want stereo sound, or mono + mic support."
2	:	"The sounds is fine, but I thought they would be noise isolating and they are definitely not; I have to have the volume very high to be able to hear them over traffic noise on my walk.Also, apparently my ears are too small because even using the smallest tips is painful after 20 minutes. I HATE the wings."
2	:	"Bought these headphones thinking they were the best in quality, and sound. Was disappointed, not only did this headphones' material lift up after about 3 months of use but the battery life is not what I expected or advertised. The lifted up material makes them susceptible to water damage so unable to use for running/sports. I don't know if this is a problem that happens to anyone or just me but for $150 dollars this was not what I expected. Less from a world renowned brand like BOSE."
3	:	I really wanted to love these. But...*They're are bulky and uncomfortable fitting*They are heavy*The sound quality isn't consistent. Often the volume sounds lowI can't see using them for any physical activities but they call quality is fantastic. Even better than my Bose BT2. So for that I'll keep them.
5	:	"I used to have the Bose Quiet Control 30 which I loved, but my car was broken into and they were stolen. I got these instead because they were less expensive but they are really great little headphones. My favorite thing about them is that they are light and don't have a bulky bar that goes behind the neck. Plus, they curl up into a tiny carrying case that I can just throw into my purse. I wear them while I'm at work and I can be as active as I need to be without sacrificing great sound! My only complaint is that the earbuds themselves are a little large for my ears."
5	:	I don't think I can say enough good things about these. I have very small ears so I was a little nervous but they are totally comfortable. The battery seems to last pretty long and pausing and switching to different songs couldn't be easier.
5	:	"Work well, just remember to download the Bose app to update the firmware and to swap out the default ear tips as needed.  I ended up trying all three sizes before settling on the medium tips for the perfect fit.  I have used them running extensively and now don't use my wired Bose headphones any more."
4	:	"yeah, pretty nice, okay their ------g excellent. I love um.I put 4 stars so you would read this. Yes you pay for them but their BOSE !and they are excellent. you won't be sorry. Life is short have cool ear buds."
5	:	"Great headphones. I was looking for headphones that wouldn???t fall out of my ears and would provide decent sound quality at a reasonable price. These definitely fit the bill. I hardly notice they are in and the quality of sound is there.My only issue is that they aren???t as loud as I would like. I use these for running, and as others noted, you can hear what is going on around you, but even still they fail to reach a desirable sound level. For instance, not as good as my apple headphones.In all, I would definitely purchase again. If you are looking for headphones that offer sound quality, look, and won???t slip out of your ears, you should definitely consider these."
4	:	"These headphones are a solid bluetooth headset for all around usage though have room for improvement.Sound Quality: 7/10Fit: 9/10Connection: 10/10Size: 7/10First sound quality: Initial impressions were not great with these headphones. It seemed as though they were just not loud enough. The highs and mids are clean but the bass was lacking. First of all, I was listening to music streamed from Spotify (at 320kb/s) through my iPhone 7. I typically like to listen to music loud which was why my initial impression was bleak. Strangely, however, it seems as though to get these headphones to get loud you have to get to the last three bars of the volume control on an iPhone. Once I figured this out, I was very pleased. At higher volumes, the sound does not distort, typical of Bose, which is quite pleasing. Other than having to crank up the volume to get them to a worth-while listening range, the sound is clean through the range. The could have a bit more bass, though clean bass is better than more distorted bass any day.Fit: Fit is really nice. The silicone ear tips are softer than other buds I have used (most recently the JayBird X2) which makes you feel like nothing is in your ear. The buds themselves are rather large, though the main section of the bid does not touch your ear. The silicone tip keeps the plastic housings far enough away that they never touch your ear. This is great for active people that are looking for bud that fits well in your ear and stays put. These are, by far, the best fitting buds for working out. The softer tips allow the buds to flex and move around more than other buds so if you bump the buds they do not fall out of your ears like most will (these fit far better and stay put far better, for me, than the JayBird X2 with foam tips). Also adding the clip to the cord so you can attach the cord to the back of your shirt prevents snags that will tear the bud from your ear. Overall the fit is great and better than any bud I've had. I have run, weight trained, biked, and jump rope with these and they have never come out of my ear yet, and you barely feel them in there in the first place. I am excited to try them while golfing this spring.Connection: The buds connect super fast, which is great. I haven't had any issues with them connecting. With the Bose app, you can connect to two sets of headphones at the same time to listen to the same thing, simultaneously. I'm not sure when this would prove useful as everyone has a phone and their own headphones, but you can use it if you want. It's an interesting feature and might prove useful for some.Size: Common fact, these buds are larger than most, but don't be discouraged by that, again you barely feel them in your ear. They do not feel heavy or intrusive. I feel that the size is a benefit as the components of the bud are more outside of your ear, which means they may have better connectivity and better battery life. The JayBirds were compact but battery life was low and the Bluetooth would drop every now and then.Overall these are great earbuds. The only area for improvement would be the sound quality. If Bose can figure out how to increase the bass and keep it clean, I'd give them a 5 star rating."
2	:	"No matter which size ear piece I switch too, in order to stay in my ear, it still pops out, even when the info said sometimes one size may fit different in  one ear compare to the other ""I get that"" but it still will not  stay in totally, I will not buy this type of headset product again, probably stick to over the ear and I will tryout BEATS on my next order. Also not as loud....."
1	:	I had this product for three months and now it doesn't work. I will charge it 100% and half an hour into listening to music it would turn off and and turn back on. This time around i tried to charge it again but the red light would just show up but will not turn back on. It appears that the headset has stopped working. For those who are interested in buying this product from BOSE - my response would be a big fat NO NO NO.
4	:	"Sounds great, but I have to turn them almost all the way up. I liked that it came with three different sizes to try out - small, medium, large - for ears. The clip is a good add on, and they haven't fallen out while running."
5	:	"These headphones are surprisingly good! The sound quality is as good as my Bose over the ear headphones. The battery life is very good. I'd spend a little more for these as opposed to the cheaper options. The cheaper ones, in my experience you ""pay for what you get"", and the Bose is more ""get what you paid for"". Good solid value."
2	:	"The sound quality and volume control are great, but it only last for less than 6 hours playing continuously, probably 4 hrs, it advertised at 6. I only used it for less than three weeks, the first week the control buttons acting weird, it doesn't work at all in the middle of my work out session and I can't even turn it off. It fixed itself after about an hour. That issue does not occur again afterward. However, 2 weeks later, I was running a 10K event in the morning and was using it, after the run, there were a static sound in the left earbud, it won't go away even when I turn off the headphone. I am in the process of returning this product and get a refund. Will update on how the process goes."
5	:	Got this on a black friday sale. It's lightweight and fits comfortably for my daily commute. Battery life is ok. But I charge it every other day so I know I won't run out of juice mid commute. It would go down let's say 10-15% battery life after an 1.25 hour commute.
2	:	"Sound is great. Ergonomics not so much. Relatively heavy ear pieces expected to stay in place based on some assumed universal ear anatomy. If for instance you try to run with them, prepare to continually fidget with them as you try to keep them jammed in your ears."
1	:	"Worthless and highly disappointed, today right after 5 uses my beloved bose were damaged, literally 5 uses and they are broken, bose this time and for the very first time you had disappointed with a low quality product..."
1	:	"After 4 months of using the earbuds they started to fall apart.  Now 8 months of using them, Bluetooth to iPhone 8 is failing. Stay away from these unless you have money to throw away.  I barely used them and at the pase they are looking trashy is impressive."
1	:	"I gave this as a gift.  Within 1 month, the left earbud faded, then went completely silent. When I got it back and went to return it, I was told the window to return had closed.  Very low quality; I am surprised this is actually a Bose.  None of the quality or durability or value I was expecting.  Terrible experience, stay far far away from this product."
5	:	"The battery charging issue was resolved after a reset of the processor (instructions below). Have to give them a five star rating now that they are what they should have been right out of the box. Sorry, I fall under the line of thinking that when you pay over $100 for headphones, they should work right out of the box, especially a Bose product. All that being said, a great sport headphone that never falls out of my ears and offers very good sound quality. You will not realize you have headphones in after a while except for the wires grazing your neck or cheek every once in a while on more intense exercises.It was hard for me to rate these headphones five stars outright because I got the battery issue that many others seem to have gotten where the battery will indicate being fully charged with a green light but when you turn them on to use them, the headphones will say ""Battery at 60%"".I had to do a ""processor reset"" and did it 4 or 5 times just to be sure they were fully reset. Here is how I understood to do the reset and it worked for me:1) Ensure headphones are off by turning them on then off and waiting 30 seconds2) Plug the headphones into the provided charging cable, plugged directly into the wall, for 5 seconds3) Unplug the charging cable from the headphones and wait one minute4) Turn on the headphones and ensure the headphones are still working5) Repeat as necessary (took 4-5 times in a row to fix the charging issue of not charging to 100%)"
5	:	"I???ve been using it almost for a year and haven???t had any problem at all, they haven???t gotten out of my ears for a single time, one advice though if you don???t use your nails when you push the buttons, they won???t get deformed.Once I forgot earphone was in my pocket and I sat on it then I broke the clip attached to the cable, so it???s easy to break if you don???t care, poor clip.I use Apple products and no connection problem.Sound quality is just perfect.Build quality 4/5"
2	:	"Very frustrating, the audio is constantly cutting out. Thought it was my phone at first but happens with both old phone and new phone. Also having gone back to a wired headset I know that their is no issue with the audio on either phone. Therefore it is the Bluetooth for this headset that has an issue. Have spoken with friends who have other much less expensive Bluetooth headsets and they do not experience these issues. I bought Bose because of their reputation and am extremely disappointed to find they are not the premium offering expected."
3	:	"So I did not want to give these any bad reviews. They sound great battery life is good not very heavy the quality you would expect from Bose. probably some of the best sounding here but I've ever worn. the bass was great! unfortunately I had to return these when working out they do not stay in the ears when moving around, for me at least and I tried all the attachments that came with them. If you're wearing them just to sit at a desk or walk around, then they are great! I do Rick amend them if they will stay in your ear. if they would come out with a hard earpiece curve instead of the squishy one I think that may help for the problem that I had."
5	:	Great sound quality. I've always love the bose soundsport wired earbuds and these definitely did not disappoint. I was nervous that they might be a tad bulky or too heavy causing them to fall out. That is not the case. And for me I HATE those things that wrap around your whole ear like the beats wireless earbuds have and most other wireless brands seem to have as well. The battery life is great too and they charge quickly. I will charge them maybe once a week but they have not gone dead on me yet. Overall great product thanks Bose!
3	:	"Headphones are really good at first I was able to use the headphones for 2 hours a days for 5 days a week with out having to charge. I only charge the headphones when at 10% life or less as I was always told to allow the battery to deplete for charging. After 2 Months I started noticing the charge would not hold as well as when I first got it so I had to charge every 2 days, then every day then twice a day. The battery also doesn't charge to 100% only to 90%. If this product is just defective than I would give a 5 star for quality!"
1	:	I ordered these for my husband's birthday. Within 2 weeks the power button broke. Amazon sent a replacement for the broken headphones. The second headphones stopped charging after 3 weeks.Two faulty products in a row so I just returned them. Maybe you'll have better luck.
5	:	Bought these as I was tired of cords and I love them. I use them all day everyday for work and pleasure. The sound quality is amazing and I can use for about 10 hours without having to recharge.
4	:	"Bose has a great sound - THat's for sure. That is the number 1 pro.Stability in-ear is great, it is sturdy and does not move even with vigorous movements.The one star less is due to the battery life. It says about 6 hours, and delivers about 5 - 5.5 hours; but I feel 6 hours is a bit less.I don't like charging my earphones every 6 hours if I have a continuous use.But all in all, I am extremely satisfied with the quality, built and the software of this gadget. It could have had better aesthetics, but the beautiful sound will make you forget the aesthetics.A sure buy.(Review written after 2 months of purchase. Will update after 6 months, and 1 year.)"
1	:	"Reminds me of my old portable CD player, skips a bit when you accidentally hit a small bump walking or driving down the road.  Only difference is, this is Bluetoothed to my iPhone 8plus and I???m sitting in a recliner.  Every song has a hiccup 4-5 times and it is quite annoying when you are trying to enjoy the song.  Amazon is sending me another.  We???ll see how that goes?  For now the price doesn???t justify the product."
2	:	"I was excited to receive these wireless Bose headphones, since I currently use the wired MIE2 in ear headphones from Bose. I expected the fit to be the same, just wireless. They're not. They fit differently and are bulky to say the least. The cord around the back of the neck is cumbersome and always pulled to one side of my head. I returned these after my only workout with them. If you are expecting the same quality earbud as with their wired counterpart, you'll be unhappy."
2	:	"Bought them as a present for my son, had to return them.  He said they would not stay in his ears.  That is totally what the rating is based on.  Replaced them with a wired pair of Bose Headphones, he is happy with those."
5	:	These are fantastic. I have trouble with earphones as they never fit my ears and fall out. These are comfortable and fit perfectly and the little wings on them prevent them from falling out. The sound is fantastic ( Bose is the best!) but I particularly love the comfort.
4	:	"Really 4.5/5.0These sound very good and are really nice to wear.  I have a pair of Bose wired in-ear headphones that I paid a similar price for.  I think those headphones sound slightly better than the wireless headphones but the difference is small.  As others have noted, these ear pieces are slightly larger and heavier than their other in-ear headphones, and this causes a very small amount of extra ear fatigue after wearing for some time.  The fit is very snug, nonetheless, and I don't feel like they are likely to fall out or come lose.  The battery life is good enough, but not amazing.  I haven't timed the battery life, but I have occasionally run out of power when I didn't want to.  The maximum volume seems limited compared to my wired in-ear headphones, which has occasionally been a small irritation.Despite these small dings, these are now my go-to headphones most days.  It's an obvious win for doing dishes, shopping, running, biking, and other such activities where you are moving about.  What is less obvious is that it's a win when just sitting at the computer typing.  I didn't realize how much the headphone wires were in my way all the time until I was able to do without them.  Now when I see both headphones lying there, in inevitably pick up the wireless ones just because they are wireless."
5	:	Excellent for the gym. Amazing quality. However if you are planning to use this as your main headset to make phone calls DO NOT BUY IT... It is great for phone calls but you cannot hear yourself very well because it fits perfectly in the ear preventing you from hearing outside  noises.
5	:	"I have tried many earbuds, but they always fell out of my ear. I finally found this set that comfortably stays in. I also have a set of Apple earbuds that are hard plastic and hurt my ears, but the silicon style parts of the Bose SoundSport are extremely comfortable even after hours of use. The sound is great, obviously. Make sure you update your firmware via your phone app when you connect to ensure your hardware has its highest capabilities present."
2	:	"Loved it unconditionally until the outer rubber shell started peeling off one of the ear pieces. Of course it was the one with the on/off switch and charger port. Now I can only turn it on/off by slipping a pencil around the rubber shell and pushing the inner part of the switch. About 1 year for $150. Um, not so good. I'm working on getting a replacement but have not yet been able to make contact."
3	:	"Meh.. It may be because I have small ear openings... maybe, but they are not comfortable at all. Other than that, these are good. I don't think they are $170.00 good though.. I've had $60.00 pairs just as good as these. Also, they will not charge higher than 90%, I am going to contact Bose about this today."
4	:	"Just got these so I can't give 5 stars yet, but they are the best earbuds I've ever owned hands down.  The sound quality is amazing (for wireless earbuds), the base is solid, and they are unbelievably comfortable and won't fall out.  I highly recommend and I never write reviews.  Get the warranty.  It's a 4 year warranty and it's super cheap on amazon.  It's $150 bucks for amazing wireless earbuds that will last a minimum of 4 years with the warranty.  100% worth it in my opinion.  I did a ton of research and I am completely satisfied that I decided on these ones."
2	:	"These fall out when I'm walking.  Not to happy.  As far as staying in my ears, Beats by Dre worked better.  As far as being reliable, no.  These are pretty terrible."
2	:	"every time the phone rings, when i press the answer button on the headohone, it said ""bla bla bla disconnected...""  then it answers the call but can not hear the other person because the headphones said very loud ""bla bla bla connected"" had lost about 100 calls because of that issue... been searching the web on how to setup differently but have found nothing"
1	:	I guess the good news is that the sound quality was fine.  Howeve after two months of use it would hold a full charge for a half hour.  A full charge to zero in 30 minutes.  Clearly it's not usable.  Given the price it's a let down and a poor reflection on Bose.
5	:	"Fantastic sound quality and easy to connect to all my devices.  Very rarely does the sound cut out and there's no disruption when my phone is in my pocket.  Still holding together after 6 months of backpacking, very pleased with the quality."
5	:	I didn't know what I was missing by waiting so long to buy these. My husband had some black ones so I got this color to tell them apart. Good choice on my part. It is so nice not to have to deal with a cord down to my phone and these actually stay in my little ears.
5	:	"The sound is outstanding, I played a song that I have played a hundred times, I heard faint voices and looked through the window to the yard and realized for the first time the voices were imbedded in the music. The mid range is as I would expect and layered seamlessly with a rich bass and a smooth high end frequencies for an overall quite balanced sound.Phone conversations are clear and the 3rd party app support (I downloaded endomondo) for integration of the pulse rate is a very nice feature for workouts or general pulse monitoring. The pulse rate seems to be right on the mark.Bose has maintained its stellar reputation with me."
4	:	"The headphones come with three fitment silicone items, which are extremely comfortable and much better than the two prior sets of cheapo wireless headphones I've had from China. They do not fall out when running, but perhaps the cord connecting the two buds is too long. Nevertheless, the microphone works well.I don't like the charging, however. The battery has to be completely depleted in order to charge. I tried different USB ports, but to no avail. I still like the product, but would like everyone to know about this issue."
4	:	Great sound as expected. Clean and crisp. Unmatched. My issue: constantly lost connectivity! Drove me nuts! Went to the website to troubleshoot. No help. Emailed the company yet they never responded. Very disappointed. Had such high expectations.
4	:	"I have always been a fan of sound quality for Bose's audio gear, and this one does not disappoint. The battery life if longer could have helped. Ear retention might be a problem at times. Overall, getting bang for the huge bucks paid."
2	:	"For the cost, sincerely disappointed in the base/general volume. For $150 I expected it to drown out all other noise and have some kick, but these really do not do it for me. very good headphones if they were $60, fidelity is great and they stay in your ears well and comfortably, but its not enough to justify the price when I can get off-brand bluetooth headphones for $30 that are much louder."
5	:	"Comes with the quality you expect of Bose; sound, construction, and material. There???s never an issue with the Bluetooth function (unless you have too many devices around), the sound quality is wonderful, the controls are easy to feel and use while wearing, and the charge lasts a surprisingly long time."
5	:	"Absolutely love these headphones. great fit, comfort, and sound is awesome. I swore I would never get expensive headphones, but since it was a good deal, why not. Worth it!"
2	:	"I bought these in March and then in early May they failed.  Bose sent me another pair and they've also failed after only a couple of weeks of usage.  As best as I can tell, the issue is that they are not even a little bit sweat resistant.  I wear them to run in and while the sound is pretty decent, eventually you get tons of static in one or both ears, the pair just shuts off entirely, and/or they won't hold a charge.  Complete disaster for the amount of money.  DO NOT BUY."
3	:	Sounds great but would not stay in my ear while running.  Tips are slightly different than older wired SIE2 sport ear buds and do not stay in as well.  The SIe2's have a piece that sits in the ear canal whereas these wireless sound sport have a more conical shaped piece to block ambient sound out but prevents the extra engagement in your ear.
5	:	"This are wonderful.  Use them when I run along with an apple watch with a synced playlist.  Can't beat these.  I had to do a google search to figure out how to get it paired, but once that was solved, it's been bulletproof."
5	:	I???m a runner. I love this heahdphones...I usually hate earbuds cause they hurt my ears...but I???m glad I took the risk to buy this and they stay in my ears. great product and sound!
5	:	"The sound quality is AMAZING!!!  The bass is perfect and has that feeling of being in your car volume set high with the bass shaking your windows.  Listen to ""Mask Off"" by Future.  They a comfortable on the ears and the rubber wings really keep the ear buds locked in. I'm very happy with my Bose SoundSportsCons:  You can't listen to music while they are charging.  To charge 100% it takes 2hrs."
5	:	Unfortunately these were stolen from me with  a week that I received them but for the short time that I had them they worked wonderfully! Never had a chance to test them while exercising.  One of the only concerns I had was not losing them from around my neck.
1	:	"I originally loved these headphones as the sound is excellent and they stayed in my ears. I did find two annoying things about them when I ran with them. First the wire would stick to my neck once I started to sweat and second the clip would slide having to constantly readjust. However, I'm only giving them one star as the first headphone stopped  working after one wek. I got a replacement right away but the second headphones stopped working after two weeks. I decided to return them and got a refund."
1	:	"I tried with all the attachments and it won't stay very long in my ears. I move rapidly and it will fall out. Also, the look is not ideal. It looks like your Frankenstein with a screw in your head. Returned to Amazon and got a different pair."
5	:	"Stay in your ear under the most strenuous exercise, base is strong, battery life is excellent, and they charge fast, durability has been fantastic.  I have my second paid, but only because I lost my first pair.  I would highly recommend them."
2	:	"Loved them at first... After a year, the clip broke and there is no way to fix it and the ear pieces constantly fall out of the ears - and I've tried different sizes.  Also, the battery life is not good. Nice sound quality (as with all Bose), but I do not recommend. Spend your money elsewhere."
1	:	I bought these in Nov so I can no longer return them. I expected them to last years considering the price I paid. They are falling apart cosmetically. They also say they are fully charged when they are really at 60%. The sound still works but probably not for long.
1	:	The battery life on these is AWFUL! It???s so annoying and super disappointing!!!!
1	:	"Bought this for my wife as a gift. First set worked for about two months the one ear piece stopped working. Called Bose (great cuatomer support) and they sent a new headset. Second time they worked fine for about another month or so. They simply did not turn back on. Called Bose and sent another pair. This time they sent the model that measures your HR. Worked for a couple of weeks and now one of the ear pieces stopped working. I love Bose products, but come on!!! 3 times and still the same issue??? Moving on to another brand."
4	:	"While I generally go crazy for Bose products. This one leaves me a little less than dazzled.  That???s why I gave it four stars, as opposed to five.  It???s not because of the sound??? As always, the sound is amazing??? It???s because of the field in the ear canal.They charge quickly, and the charge stays strong for several hours. I???ve never run out during any airplane flight,  or while watching any movies. There???s nothing negative I could say about the sound. Also, very simple to set up for the first time and pair to my Bluetooth devices. I just wish there were some more options regarding the inter-ear placement. Maybe some soft foam? Anyway, wonderful sound, very easy to operate."
5	:	Great quality and easy to hook up. I have two pairs of these and purchased this for aomeone else. Fits nicely in your ear and sound is nose quality. If you???re looking for wireless headsets look no further especially if you work out and run.
5	:	Love these!!! They stay in well. Very comfortable. Good sound. Great for making calls on your phone. Worth the money.
5	:	I used to just use the iPhone earbuds but they were super annoying at the gym.  The wires always got in the way and my phone would fall out all the time.  The best part is the little clip on the back that you can use to clip to your shirt and that way you can walk around with one earbud (so you can talk to your bro) and the one that???s still in try???s to rip your ear off.
5	:	"Bought these earbuds for my mom and she's been raving about them nonstop. They are wireless and connects effortlessly with her iPhone 7. She uses them when she's out running. The rubber is flexible and molds to your ear canal, it doesn't fall out easily like the other ones she's had before. Really recommend it!"
5	:	"These are great headphones.  I wear them for hard workouts.  They sound great and stay in my ears.  I think the sound rivals any headphones I have owned, wireless or wires.  The battery life is solid."
3	:	"I really like my original corded Bose earphones, they're very comfortable. These do not have that same comfort, I can't see wearing them comfortably for a few hours like on long commercial flights. I've tested all three ear piece sizes, the medium fit well but create discomfort. The sound quality is good for bluetooth, but don't expect the same quality as with a normal cord set. I'm not sold on these; might return."
4	:	"Sound quality is good. It took me a few tries to sync heart rate with Runkeeper app, but it works nicely without having to wear a strap around your chest. The clothing clip fell off and got lost within the first few uses, but Bose is sending me a replacement clip at no charge. I hope it doesn't get lost as easily as the first one."
1	:	"These are great. As far as phone calls, the speaker picks up a lot of background noise. But the sound is great on my end.Amended:  don???t buy these. I???ve a ton of trouble with them for phone calls. For the price they should work better."
3	:	"I loved these headphones. They did fit weird but that was not an issue. The biggest issue was that in a few months the rubbering around the BOSE brand started to come apart. The clicker started to fall apart as well and was inconvenient to skip, replay, increase or decrease volume."
5	:	"I've tried at least three different brands of wireless earbuds.  The Bose SoundSport is easily the best of the ones I tried, and worth the money. (One of the other two was nearly as expensive, and a terrible buy!)"
5	:	"my son got this or christmas and absolutely loves it. locks easily in the ear, great fidelity convenient storage, great connectivity, terrific all the way around. my son is a teen ager. i'm older and would use it myself if i wasn't worried about misplacing it. but i highly recommend it."
5	:	"I was very apprehensive to purchase these, wasn't sure how they would fit. They're perfection. The length of the cord is such that it doesn't flap all over when running. The buds fit and don't fall out or move when running. And lastly the sound is amazing. My comparison is to that of Beat Wireless 2 and I have to say the outrank them. Better design. Loving them so far!"
3	:	"I have been buying Bose since 1981. On this occasion however, I have the same problem as with their previous ear bud headphones. They simply don't fit and stay in my ear. Have yet to download the Bose Connect app and actually hear something from these headphones. I'll just have to keep trying."
4	:	Good I like the sound ended up giving these to mom as they let in too much outside noise for me at the gym. Comfortable though and the sound was very good. Seemed like my other bose though you have to turn them up to about the 75% range for decent volume.
5	:	"I've had several Bluetooth wireless headphones over the years, including Jaybird and LG. I like these the best. They're comfortable and stay securely in my ears. These stay put, unlike just about any other earphones I've ever worn.Sound quality is excellent, and I like that they announce the battery level with each power-on."
1	:	"I'm SOOOO disappointed. I'm an avid runner and purchased the wireless Bose SoundSport headphones. The good: when they worked, they were absolutely the best wireless headphones I've had. The bad: I went through 2 pair in less than a month. In both cases, the left earphone started crackling loudly, and continued even after the unit was powered off. I requested a replacement when this happened to the first set, and I had the same issue with the second set. I was about 10 miles into an 18 mile run and the left earphone started just popping and crackling loudly. By the time I got home, I was no longer able to even turn them on or charge them. So sad. I am a heavy sweater, but these were supposed to be able to deal with that."
5	:	"Great headphones, a little uncomfortable after several hours of wear but that's pretty much to be expected. Only minor issue I have is the cord is a bit tangled and awkwardly lays to one side of my head/shoulder instead of being balanced in the middle."
4	:	"Nicely made, decent sound quality. Installed ear plugs a bit big for my ear but they include multiple sizes. A bit clunky but overall a good, exercise headphone. Very happy with my purchase so far."
5	:	"Must have for commutes, running or taking calls.  Sound clarity for both music and calls is amazing. No one even knows I'm talking hands free when I use these"
3	:	"***Update after owning these for a month*** - The clip broke. All I did with it was clip it to my collar as it is intended to be used. Now I have no clip. They still work, but at this price, I expect perfection. I am dropping my review to three stars because of this defective important part. See photos.The sound quality is outstanding. The comfortable fit is nice. I have gone through at least half a dozen Bluetooth ear phones in the past two months and this set is so much better than the rest. You pay for the quality, but if you are like me and use them everyday, 200 bucks is a fair enough price to pay for quality and reliability."
5	:	Came partially charged. They truly are worth every penny!!! I popped them in and silence! Great at cancelling out noise. Soundnis crisp and clear. When using connected to a phone call other party can hear perfectly clear - and works at least 100ft away from phone.
5	:	Great sound! These stay put in my ears even when working out. I love them! I did have to watch a YouTube video to learn to put them on correctly. Smooth sailing once I knew what I was doing. And they hold a charge forever. Not literally forever but a good long time.
5	:	Bought these to wear at the gym so that my phone could be in my bag and not have to be on me physically.  They work great!  I've also used them to talk on my cell phone at home.  There are 3 sizes of the pieces that fit in your ear to ensure a comfortable fit.  They fit securely and stay in place.  Sound quality is excellent as one would expect from Bose. Very satisfied.
1	:	"One of the worst headphones I've ever purchased. Batteries last fully charged for one hour. To return it Bose ""offers"" to email you a label, so you have to print the label and purchase your own shipping material then bring it to the post office. You then have to wait 10 days from when they receive it and then it takes 10 more days for them to mail a replacement to you. So, 20 days later you may have headphones that work or you may have gone 20 days without headphones for nothing. I advise you choose a different product."
1	:	Sound and bass quality are solid but they won't even turn on anymore and I bought them on Sept 10th 2017. 3 months of use is hardly worth it's cost of 150
5	:	"Sound quality is excellent.  I've noticed their is more of a delay using the skip to next song button than standard wired headphones.  They also skip like an old CD would.  I think it's the bluetooth connection getting interrupted?  It doesn't bother me so much, but I've never had any other bluetooth headphones, so I'm not sure if this normal or not.I did some research on the skipping.  Turn off WIFI,  disconnect headphones and reconnect headphones.  No more skipping.  5 Stars now!"
5	:	"Put these on and forget about the world around you. Amazing headphones, best I've used. I fell asleep with them on, woke up forgetting they were still on, and thought I was in a concert or something. Was watching a movie on my laptop with them on and thought the birds chirping in the movie, were real. If you're on the fence, buy 'em."
3	:	"have my Bose for 4 months now. At first they were everything,  now, if I'm on a call and I switch over from one conversation to the next, the volume is extremely low and when I turn it on and off it's still low, then I will have to wait awhile before it gets back to working correctly. I paid too much for these headsets for this to happen, especially so soon after. I mean at least give me two years before it starts messing up."
2	:	"Customer service has been great, and when they work, sound quality is great.  The problem is, after 8 months of ownership i have just sent back my FIFTH pair.  Two pair stopped charging after a few weeks, two pair stopped turning on, and most recently, this last set wouldn't stop attempting to pair with my phone.The warranty is terrific, but going to the UPS store every 4-6 weeks gets old fast."
5	:	"I bought these headphones as a gift for a friend. He loves them and says that the sound is fantastic. He has had to send them back a couple of times for issues that have occurred, however, the customer service has been so wonderful that he doesn't mind at all. It is so lovely when a company takes responsibility for their product and knows how to treat customers. My friend is very happy with these headphones and uses them every day and has for quite a long time."
1	:	They were good while they worked... for about a whole 3 months then the buds stopped working. I was very disappointed because for the price I paid I expected them to last a lot longer than what they did.  Who do I contact to talk about warranty or refund...
4	:	"Bose speakers and headphones always blows my mind with the sound. This one, sound is average and when my husband use it to talk to me over the phone, it picks up every surrounding sounds. For the $$ not impressed."
4	:	well after using it for a while i would recommend it for the athlete it really grabs on the ears
3	:	"I got these headphones 9 months ago and have used them almost every day. The sound quality is great and the battery usually lasts 6-8 hours easy.Over time though, plastic pieces of these headphones have become unglued and fallen off. I didn't mind at first, but now several of the buttons are difficult to operate because their plastic button coverings have started peeling off."
5	:	"Sound great, feel great, easy to put on and take off, love the color, easy to charge. No complaints!"
5	:	"Bose is the BEST!  Great sound, great quality. They always have the most comfy headphones.  I've had other earbuds that make my ear holes RAW and tender.  Got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he can't stop talking about how much he loves them! I have my own pair already and knew I wanted to get these for him when he complained of his wireless headphones hurting his ear-holes."
4	:	I love all Bose products except this one. Product is great quality & sound as expected but weight of ear piece keeps it from staying in my ears regardless of which size ear piece I used! Don't like the look either...to large! Returned but love Bose sound!
5	:	"The Bose SoundSport headphones are awesome! They have the best sound I've ever heard from ear bud headphones. They are extremely light and with the earpieces they have, there is no slipping out of the ear when running. I highly recommend these headphones."
5	:	"Firstly i didnt expected much from this headphones but one thing that Bose normally does is surprise me, best quality i think even better than apple airpods, very useful at the moment of traveling (idk they come with they own case) and doing excercise."
5	:	"Amazing device! Only complaint would be that the little clip that holds the headphones to your shirt (which is really important actually) doesn't stay attached to the headphones well. So it's very easy to lose. Other than that, this thing is perfect."
5	:	I bought these after my wireless Beats broke. These are more comfortable and have better sound. They have to be more durable too. I should have listened to the reviews and bought these first.
2	:	"Sound is pretty nice, battery is terrible. On a $100+ set of ear buds I expect to get more than an hour at full volume, can't even get through a full workout on a 100%charge"
5	:	I am putting the review just after day one of listening and I hope they will be same in coming days.I read a lot of reviews where people are saying they are bulky but I don't think so. These are gorgeous headphones which sounds like they supposed to be... like Bose. Amazing sound. They are not noise cancellation but outside interfarance is very minimal. I would say just buy and experience them
4	:	"Working out with these is far better than the typical ear buds. I have a drop out sometimes, but I'm still seeing if it's the Pandora app or the ear buds. It has awesome features and I'm doing a review on them. They also announce calls so you don't have to look at the phone. Other great options as well. Still waiting on my warranty."
2	:	"I love the sound quality. They are ultra reliable in terms of connectivity.But I bought them in march and the plastic sleaving first came off in one place in April. Now its december and there is more gaffs tape than original plastic sleeve. I expect so much more from Bose. I have been very gentle with them, they are draped around my neck, in my ears or in the special Bose brand case I bought for them and they have all but disintegrated."
4	:	"I love these for listening to music /movies on my phone, and being hands free. The battery life is excellent - about 7 hours. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the mic is super sensitive. If I'm doing anything while talking it's deafening to whomever you're speaking to."
5	:	"Bought these for my daughter after many of her friends recommended these. She is very happy with them. They are a bit expensive though. Bose, like other popular brands,  is always overpriced."
2	:	"These head phones do sound really great,  Very crisp sound. The only thing about the sound quality is that they are not Noise cancelling (you can hear wind and ambient noise). The big problems for me is that the cord busted only after 6 months of daily use (weightlifting, and walking around campus). By busted I mean that the plastic cover that protects the wires broke exposing the wires near one of the ear buds. The other problem is that you can???t wear them for too long. The earbuds are very heavy and can hurt after wearing them for over an hour."
5	:	I used Beats Studio Wireless headphones for 4 years and decided it's time for a change. This is the best decision I've ever made! The crisp sound of Bose will have you pushing yourself harder in the gym and make it hard to leave because you don't want to take them off. Quit hesitating on spending a little extra money and purchase these headphones.
1	:	"UPDATE: 11/09/17Well maybe I spoke too soon. Somehow my earphones will not charge anymore. It just blinks then turns red no matter how low I charge it. I used different cables, adaptors, nothing works.  Very disappointed.???"
1	:	"I was so excited about these headphones. Before purchasing, I had bought several cheaper Bluetooth headphones that had bad sound quality, a short battery life and/or lost the connection with my phone.These Bose headphones had none of those problems -- the sound quality was amazing and they connected to all of my devices in seconds. Then 2 months later they started to fall apart, pieces started to come loose and eventually fell off. I've glued some pieces back on. But when the button that controls volume and answers calls fell off I gave up."
2	:	"When I bought these I expected more since they are Bose.  The two biggest issues I have with them are the comfort and sound suppression.  After wearing these for an hour or so, my ears begin to hurt, I've tried the smaller size ear buds but it feels like they are going to fall out.  The other main issue is the lack of ambient noise suppression.  I can hear everything going on around me and therefore have to increase the volume in order to hear what I'm listening to.  The battery life isn't that great either."
5	:	Gave as a gift so have no personal experience with these.  By report easy to find a great fit and stay in place. My brother runs ultra-marathon and has been super happy with these headphones. So the gift was a big hit...  Love the color choices as well.
5	:	"I returned my BeatsX because they weren???t that comfy and had zero bass. Funny right? A company known for bass not having any!I got these Bose in the mail and immediately tried them on. They were night and day better - comfort, sound, and quality.As I???m listening to music using the default music app, I downloaded the Bose app to see what it???s about. It showed me how to wear them, by turning each ear piece into your ear.HOLY COW!!!!The sound is even better! The bass hits even harder and I can even lower the volume a bit more.  Not only that, but outside noises are reduced significantly."
5	:	Love my headphones great sound and great quality! You get 3 sets of different size buds to fit your ears.The one thing that I notice is the charging closure is a flimsy silicon cover that will eventually break off because of the way it attaches and how you have to peel it back. I am very careful when I need to charge.
5	:	"Love love love these! Very comfortable working out, riding in a car, and have fallen asleep with them on a few times. Great sound quality and voice pick up for phone calls as well. Holds a charge very nicely and convenient carry case for when I'm not wearing them. Highly recommend"
5	:	"EXCELLENT! Got rid of my Beats headphones and bought another pair of these for my wife so we could both enjoy the clarity of our music. Workj well with laptops, iPads, iPhones and TV's. I'm also a recording engineer and usually use Sony Studio Monitor headphones, but now use my Bose for private listening at home."
1	:	did not last long start to fall apart
5	:	Bose seems to always satisfy.  I had purchased similar but different brand head set which I sent backdue to poor sound quality.  These Bose sound great.
4	:	They're Bose. So off the bat you know they're going to have great sound.But they truly are great for working out/running. And I've been through A LOT of wireless headphones for working out over the past few years. Think I'm done looking
5	:	"Super high quality headphones. After doing quite a bit of research on the best sport headphones I landed on these. Very happy with them. The sound is very clear, regardless of how high you turn up the volume. They never come out of your ears. Love the shirt clip that it attached to them also. Would definitely recommend"
5	:	"These sound excellent.  They are very comfortable. I liked them so much, I bought a pair for my wife she also loves them.  It took me a few tries to get the hang of inserting them in my ears.  My wife picked up on it instantly"
1	:	Have had connection issues from day 1. It's ridiculous for something this expensive to be such a terrible product with awful connectivity problems. Every song sounds like a skipping CD no matter what distance my phone is from the headphones. I've used bluetooth on my phone connect with other devices and have never had this much of a problem.
3	:	"I bought these headphones in February of 2017 and initially I loved them. I run with them every day and they have great sound, long battery life, quick charging and good range.However, after a year, the on/off button is malfunctioning. I have to stick a toothpick in the right spot to get the headphones to turn on/off and charge.  I went on the Bose support site and evidently I'm not alone-- this is a common problem. I've taken very good care of these headphones and I'm extremely disappointed that a quality brand item would have such a short life span."
2	:	"The sound quality was above my expectations and very similar to the wired version of the headphones. However, the battery life is pretty awful. It seems like I am constantly charging them. I would say the battery lasts for maybe 5 hours. If you use these only for workouts they are fine. If you use them to listen to music for long periods of time, like while working, be aware of the battery limitations."
5	:	"For several years now, Bose headphones have been a staple in our household.  It began with the Bose QC15 over-ear noise canceling headphones.  That purchase made us spoiled by great sound and discontent with any lesser pair of speakers of any type.  So, could Bose duplicate their incredibly high audio standard on a small pair of wireless and rugged in-ear headphones?  The answer is, absolutely!  That said, the Bose SoundSport Wireless may not be for everyone. There are trade-offs that you should know about before you buy.  I have had my pair for a couple of weeks now.  Here are the details of my experience with the headphones...SOUND QUALITYThe sound quality is absolutely fantastic. To describe it with just one word, the sound is RICH!  There is a quality depth and warmth to the music that is better than I have ever heard on Bluetooth in-ear headphones. The music also comes across very detailed and dynamic. The high notes on a guitar tickle my ears while a deep bass line has more than enough punch to get me jiving.  If you are new to Bose, you will be thrilled with the sound quality.  If you already own other Bose speakers, then you will appreciate that the company's rich sound signature has not been lost on this wireless pair of sport headphones.FIT & COMFORTThe Stay Hear ear tips do an amazing job of, well, actually staying in your ears. I also have a pair of Bose QC20 headphones with the same type of tips.  With nearly two years of use, the ear pieces have NEVER fallen out with the QC20's. Not even when the wire is caught and tugged. Thus far, my experience has been the same with the new SoundSport. They have never fallen out.  Plus there is no tethered wire to worry about getting caught on something. Perfect for activity. While jogging, washing the car and other various activities the headphones just stay in with no adjustment.The silicon tips are also very comfortable though not as soft as those on the QC20.  I assume that the extra heft is to hold the additional weight that the SoundSport earpieces have. Understandable as the earpieces house a battery, Bluetooth antenna, buttons and other electronics. It is surprising that they still feel as comfortable and natural in the ear as they do.BLUETOOTHPairing was straight-forward on my iPhone, iPad and iMac.  I love that they are NFC enabled.The Bluetooth range is fairly great.  I can leave my phone in one place and walk anywhere in our two story 2500 sq foot home without a dropout.  When listening away from home (phone in a pocket), I also have never experienced even a hiccup in the connection.My only difficulty with the Bluetooth turned out to be something I appreciate.  Let me explain.... once paired, the headphones automatically connect to the last two devices they were paired with. When you first power on the headphones, if one of those two devices is not in range, then the headphones find and reconnect to any other previously paired device.  This is great, but for me it worked almost too well.  One time I powered on the headphones to listen to music on my iPhone only to find music playing from the iMac that my wife was using.  So, my wife wondered why her music was no longer audible on her computer and I was confounded by the mystery music on my headset.  This type of scenario happened a couple of times and became very annoying until we downloaded the Bose connect App.  With the App, we can now easily tell the headphones which device we want connected.  Presently, I have grown to appreciate how ""sticky"" the Bluetooth pairing is.  I have never had to re-pair anything and I can easily switch between devices using the Connect App. By the way, the App also automatically updates the firmware on the headphones when needed. Nice!DURABILITYI read several older reviews where people had faulty units with a malfunctioning earpiece overtime. I also read somewhere that Bose  found the issue and fixed the problem in its latest production.  I have had no issue with my pair.  Everything feels solid and built for abuse.  By the way, the included neoprene case feels incredibly seamless and protects the headphones very well.BATTERY LIFEBose states that the headphones get up to six hours battery life per charge. I have found this to be fairly accurate. The battery has never died on me mid-workout.  Neither have I ever been surprised when they do need charging because of the voice prompt that announces the battery with each power on.  Still, consider that they are yet another thing to charge.  For me, a welcome concession to be able to exercise wire free.CONCLUSIONIn the end, I am very happy with the Bose SoundSport Wireless. The bottom-line is that they sound fantastic, are comfortable, they stay in place and keep a reliable Bluetooth connection.  If you are in the market for workout ready headphones - I highly recommend the SoundSport Wireless.  I expect to enjoy mine for"
5	:	Great headphones. I use them on my iPhone 7 and the only issue I've had has been with the phone. Although there is kind of a lot of weight hanging at your ear it is comfortable and I've not has issues with them falling out.
2	:	I'm updating my review because I've had these barely 8 months and they've already started to malfunction. I've spent the last two days thinking there was something wrong with my left ear but it was the left headphone. So there's that. These should have a longer life span with that price tag.
5	:	"Best headphones I???ve owned. My first pair of wired soundsports spoiled me and I have never been able to find another brand of headphones that sound great and stay in my ears comfortably. Bose has reliably provided both in these headphones. I had a pair of Jaybird Freedoms and these aren???t on the same level of deep bass sound, but they are so much more comfortable and still sound great."
5	:	These have been the best earbuds I've ever used. The are comfortable enough to wear all day without giving you ear a bruised feeling as well as the sound quality being excellent.  Being able to adjust the volume right there on the head set is a valuable function too.
4	:	The sound is great.  A true Bose product.  Knocked down a star because the clip kept coming off.  It is small and hard to find.  It finally broke off and I am unable to locate it.  The clip made a difference in getting them to stay in place.
4	:	"Bought this in September of 2017 and used only a few times until the last few months of 2018.  Beginning November 2018, I started having issues with the volume button causing a screeching noise.  A week later, earbuds began randomly losing sound and wouldn???t power down for a few minutes.  For the cost and the brand, I expected much better.  The sound prior to this was absolutely amazing, couldn???t ask for more.  So sad."
4	:	The headphones are good except sometimes they cut out. Also when you have to devices connected to it the headphones seem to try to switch between the two instead of just overlapping the sound making it seem like they are cutting out. Other than that you can expect Bose quailty.
3	:	"For the price, I expected them to last longer. Within about 9 months of daily use for about 30-45 mins a day during my commute (a bit longer if I ran errands after work), the left ear sound started to cut in & out. Now, after a bit over a year, no sound at all in the left ear and the down volume button doesn't work. From the get-go, the volume buttons felt a little ""floppy"" and hard to press. I've had cheap headphones that have lasted for years. This splurge was a bit of a disappointment."
5	:	"Was very pleasantly surprised.  I've really never had wireless earbuds before.  They are so easy to operate, and the sound quality is amazing.  I downloaded the accompanying app, and that is really helpful in keeping up with the battery level."
4	:	I've tried a number of bluetooth headphones. Biggest thing about these is that they stay in my ear unlike the jaybirds or beats which eventually loses or fall out.Pros -- Battery life is good- Sound is good for bluetooth- Stay in earCons-- Price is a little high but its Bose- They are bigger then i'd like them to be but i've gotten use to them.
1	:	Is this a bose product? Really? The sound is just like any other cheap Bluetooth headphones and they  are not comfortable at all. Don't buy it. After 5 months the battery does not last not even 3 hours. Don't waste your money on these
5	:	"I had the Beats by Dre Powerbeats 2 before I bought these. The Powerbeats 2 simply died on me. Regardless, these are just as comfortable, and have much better sound quality. I sweat a lot at the gym and on runs, and these have done fine. They also stay put no matter what I'm doing. Basically, buy these and not Beats if you are debating."
4	:	"Great set of ear buds. I usually don't like ear buds because they make my ears sore. These are comfortable and sound amazing. Full range of sound and great clarity. They fit really well and don't come loose even while running. The reason I gave 4 stars is because the little clip that attaches to your shirt collar to keep them in place, snapped in half after about 2 weeks of use. Without that clip, they will just slide off your neck when not places in your ears. Very annoying."
3	:	"While the fit of these headphones is great, as is the sound quality and microphone, I'm dismayed about battery life and the bluetooth.  The headphones last about a day of wear, and constantly get confused on whether they're connected to my phone or computer.  Not a great bluetooth experience at all."
2	:	"got this product like an hr ago. Was extremely excited. i connected it, and in like an hour, battery died. I charged it until it said 70 percent. Used it for a good 20 mins. Bam, now down to 40 percent. This is probably the only, the ONLY product that I've gave below a 3."
2	:	I haven???t had them long enough to rate the battery life or really the quality for that matter but what I can say is right out of the box they didn???t work. They simply would not turn on. I charged them for 4 hours and still would not turn on. I called Bose direct and they ran me through a few things and then had me mail them back and then they sent me a new set. I have used them once and they seem ok. Not good to take something new right out of a sealed box and it not work. Bad experience.
5	:	"Really pleased with the sound and fit of these. Moved away from in-ear Bose headphones a few years ago because the soundsport cords were cheaply made and frayed easily. The wireless version seem more durable and hoping they hold up over time. Overall, for what I was looking for in a wireless in-ear, these are great."
3	:	The sound is incredible. It is Bose all the way. But you have to make sure to use the case when to in use. The outer parts broke off. But it fit my ear well. If you baby it when it???s not in your ear. You will be satisfied
5	:	my husband is SO picky about the fit of his headphones. I have bought and returned at least 3 pairs trying to find him the right ones. These are it!!! he loves how comfortable they are and uses them all the time. Can't go wrong with Bose!
2	:	"I have owned my pair of Bose SoundSport Wireless earplugs for a while now and figured I could comment...they are very stylish, sound great and all but the battery life is very short (much shorter than the 5 hours listed under the product description)! For the price paid and as a Bose product, I was expecting more.  They spend more time on the charger than in my ear...very disappointed."
1	:	very disappointed with the set of head phones.... bought them for my son and gave them to him this weekend early so he would have them to take on a trip. The Bose SoundSport are Horrible. His old $9 skull candy sound better.... I love Bose and have multiple products made by BOSE  but for some reason these are not the quality of their  normal products. I hope they take them back in for my sons sake...
2	:	"They constantly loose their charge when not in use.  So, I go to plug them in when I am in the mood for music, and I can't.  I have to charge them. Then, it warns me I have 4 minutes left and I end up getting 45 more minutes out of them.  Confusing little devils."
1	:	"Horrible product, I am on my second pair (after a warranty claim with Bose), these things are now falling apart the volume rocker is pealing out of the plastic and you can barely use the controls.this is very disappointing."
5	:	"I first bought a really inexpensive version ($30) of this technology by another manufacturer, and they worked... at first. I was amazed! But they were uncomfortable in my ears after about 20 minutes or so, and they soon broke, leaving me high and dry.  I thought, well, they're only 30 bucks, just buy another pair!But then I had a higher brain function that said, no, don't do that.  Instead, shell out the extra dough to see what a real quality version feels like.And man o man am I glad I did.  These are so comfortable in my ears I forget they're there. And the sound quality is full Bose. 10x better than the cheap ones, at least. Really, really glad I made the upgrade.  These will last years, they're comfortable, they sound awesome, they hold a charge well, they pair easily, great for running, working out at the gym or just watching Netflix on one's ipad.Rock n Roll!!!"
1	:	"The soundsport looks good and sounds really nice when it works, but as I used it semi often a very annoying and very glaring problem arose, I had rice krispies in my ears. By that I mean that as you use them they snap, crackle and pop in your ears. Its not terribly loud but is incredibly annoying and a they crackle and pop they stop your music. I was using these normally and under nonstranious conditions and still the crackle and popping noise happens. The also have an issue of connectivity with and signals though fabric, if I try to use the SoundSport while riding a bike it wont work."
4	:	"Granted I???ve only had these for a week but I???m very pleased so far. Not sure I understand why some folks complain about the earbuds falling out during a workout because of sweat. I???ve tried  Otium (fell out AND stopped working), rif6 (still work but fall out during workouts). For me, Apple earbuds never stay in for workouts. These are the best i???ve had BY FAR. But they are also $150. They are Bose: so great sound. The only other earbuds i???ve found that I haven???t had to adjust during a workout (and they are non Bluetooth and hurt the ear) are yurbuds (Inspire?) with the over the ear hook."
5	:	"I have been searching and trying out Bluetooth earphone for years.  This is the best by far, the battery life is excellent, the quality is great and the fit is perfect.  I use it for about an hour in the gym every day while I am running on the treadmill.  Definitely recommend the product."
3	:	"About 3 weeks after I purchased these, they literally just stopped working. Amazon replaced them for free, which was good, but about 8 months later (2 months ago), the on/off button stopped working. Well, it takes about 50 tries to turn these on or off now, or try to pair with a different device etc. Paying this much for headphones, I do not expect them to stop working less than a year in, not to mention 3 weeks in like my first pair."
5	:	I???ve gone through several pairs of cheaper wireless and wired earbuds and these are light years ahead of any of the top rated no name branded earbuds that are offered on amazon for less than say $50. I have worn them to the gym and for a few hours of yard work. The sound is very full and crystal clear with deep lows for music that is bass heavy.
5	:	"I???ve had Bose earbuds for years. After wearing mine out and waiting until I absolutely needed a new pair I went with these and I am not disappointed. They work flawlessly, fit comfortably and are amazing quality. Can listen and talk via Bluetooth, has volume control, come with multiple sized ear pieces and fun colors! You won???t regret buying these."
5	:	I use these everyday at the gym! The battery seems to last a good amount of time and charges fast! I got these because I didn't want to buy ones with out the cord. I know that I would lose them if the cord wasn't there!
2	:	"I ran for a long time using the previous (wired) Bose SoundSport In-Ear Headphones and they worked pretty well (worthy of a 4-star review, and good enough that I was excited about purchasing these successors to that concept). So I was primed to really like this product. I've now spent 3 months trying to get these headphones to stay firmly in my ear for more than a few hundred yards without loosening up and eventually beginning to fall out. At this point, I'm giving up. I've gone from judging these as unfortunately fussy to maddeningly frustrating if not worthless. Two design flaws mar this otherwise great-sounding peripheral: (1) The giant, Frankenstein-like knobs that stick out of your ears and house the electronics and the battery is so bulky and heavy that they bounce up and down with each foot strike, inevitably (for me) working their way looser and looser until they fall out, and (2) the tube over which the silicon in-ear portion of the ear buds slides is so large that no matter what size bud and ear lock you choose, they won't seat well enough into the ear canal that the ear lock tab can keep them in place.The previous (wired) Soundsports would occasionally work their way a little bit loose, reducing their bass response, but they still sounded good and never needed to be re-seated during a run. These heavier, wireless headphones, however, will literally fall out of my ears after a few hundred meters unless I'm constantly fiddling with them.Pros:- They sound great, for the short period of time they stay in your ear.- They're a great distraction for those that find running monotonous, since you constantly have something to fiddle with if you want to keep listening to your music.- The clip to fasten their cord to the back of your short is nice, so that when they fall out you don't have to go back to get them.- Giant knob sticking out of your ears allows you to use them during Halloween, for your low-budget Frankenstein costume.Cons:- The ear bud is too large for people with smaller ear canals (including men like me, who're 5'10"" and have fair-sized ears)- More variety (or a complete redesign) needed in the ear-lock tab sizes to ensure they fit and actually lock in place."
3	:	"After so many research , between Airpod n Bose , I finally go for Bose , i was happy for a month until I bought Airpod for my galfriend , I???m not complaining the sound quality , but compare to the size , charging , level of comfort , convenience .. I will say This model is something that good for someone who doing CrossFit , plyometric movement , but after long hours of wearing , its giving some discomfort on the ear hole , And the size is bit bulk , I some time rub it off when I moving my arm close to my face .I can only say it is a good sound quality earphone ."
4	:	"I was torn between these headphone and other manufacturers of similar style headphones. I would have to say I???m happy with my selection.PROSGood rangeGreat soundEasy control optionsCONSear piece fitmentBattery life vs charge timeSide note in case your worried about the side of the actual ear piece, it???s always weird at first but you get use to it and forget about shortly there after.I used them primarily for weight lifting, used during slow jogs and rowing machine with no issues. Can comment on anything more physical then that."
1	:	"I bought these earphones and was initially pleased, but three months later they stopped working. I am not completely sure why but it was very disappointed for the amount of money I paid. I would suggest invest in headphones."
2	:	They just didn't fit my ears. They couldn't keep connected to my iPhone that I keep in my back pocket. I had to return them.
4	:	"The sound quality is really good and I use it when I'm moving around a lot when I'm working. The only problem I have with it is that at times the music drops for a fraction of a second but it is pretty noticeable. However I haven't isolated what is causing this. Also the battery life might not be enough for you if you want use this constantly throughout the day. The headphones are also pretty light and fit snugly in your ear. I am currently a university student and I like these headphones because they are portable, durable, easy to pair, and have good sound quality so I can't complain too much!"
3	:	"I am finding this cumbersome to use.  Compared to other devices I routinely use (iPhone 7+, Sony Walkman, Fitbit, Canon DLSRs, etc), this one is awkward to turn on, turn off, and charge.  The on/off button is tiny. The port for the charging cord isn't easy to open, and the difference between the two sides of the plug is subtle, making it harder to get it plugged in correctly the first try."
2	:	"I have had my soundsport for less than a year.The electronics and the sound quality were good, although over time the battery had its ups and downs where it would take very long to charge and wouldnt play for long. It somehow overcame that and the battery works fine, but the bigger issue is that the material started to expand and all the rubber linings and plastic covers are falling off, including buttons. However, Idid not expose the set to unusual heat as one might expect from the symptoms."
5	:	They sound wonderful. They will stay in your ears while working out. Sweating has no affect on them. I love the sounds and the reliability of these head phones.
4	:	"At the moment, not happy. Headphones won???t charge more than fifty percent.Charging issue resolved.Best sound quality I???ve found.  Only downside is the flimsy clip to hold the headphones on and buttons are difficult to push."
4	:	"Very great and awesome product! Only thing that bothered me was that if you wear it too long it does start to hurt your ear, maybe everybody's ears different. I don't know. Other than that it's great, I would buy it again."
5	:	Definitely one of the best purchases I have made. Working out as a woman there is no where to put your phone because no women's wear has pockets. The bluetooth made it super easy to workout and the sound quality is amazing.
5	:	Worth every penny. I shopped around and was getting ready to purchase the beats headphones but have always been a fan and supporter of BOSE. Once again I am not let down. The sound from these headphones is great. They are very comfortable and intuitive. Couldn't be happier to be chord free with great sound. My only concern is I saw a review that said the build quality was low and they were falling apart. Hopefully I will not have this experience cause right niw I'm stoked!
3	:	The sound was good. But unfortunately these didn???t fit in my ears very well. They hurt and we???re way to bulky looking as well. I bought the charging case a well which is and awesome idea. I???m keeping that for the next pair of wire earphone I get and keep.
2	:	I pre-ordered this product on Amazon. The first pair was defective. Sound out of only one ear. I returned it to Amazon and received a replacement product. It worked for exactly 2 months and died in the middle of listening to music. Charging overnight has not helped. I called Bose and they are sending me a third replacement. I will update this post after a couple of months if it is still working.
5	:	"Great sound, easy fit, holds a charge well. Happy with this purchase."
5	:	"I bought this for my husband's birthday, and it turned out to be one of the best gifts that I ever got for him.  He is able to run longer, because he stays motivated.  The ear buds fit very well also, which is very important."
3	:	"Not the sound quality that I had expected for the price or from a Bose product. Minimal bass, poor sound quality and not high enough volume. Ear buds are super comfortable compared to other ear bud type head phones that I have tried. Unfortunately I think that I will be returning these because I can not justify spending $150.00 for comfort with poor sound."
5	:	I absolutely love these headphones.  They are so comfortable and do not fall out of my ears like typical earbuds do.  The sound is beautiful and clear and the way the the headphones fit into the ear they are excellent at noise reduction.  They hold their charge very well and recharge quickly. This is a great purchase!
3	:	"I love these headphones. They fit just right, look great, are functional. I use them constantly. That said, they never last me more than a year. The last pair I bought (mid-March, 2017) randomly quit being able to locate my phone over Bluetooth. They???d say they were searching, but weren???t actually discoverable. I recommend getting the warranty or purchasing with caution."
4	:	Bought these after returning the Bose soundsport free earbuds. I like these better for price and the fit. Also I feel more comfortable not losing these compared to truly wireless buds. I use the in the gym daily and usually get about 5 workouts before they need a charge. Good range and Bose quality. Great buy :)
5	:	"Fantastic gift for my husband for his birthday. The best gift he didn't know he even needed! Long battery life- rarely has to charge them. Clear sound. He uses them while working out, mowing the lawn, and working around the house!"
5	:	Love my Bose products.  I never have ear buds fit both ears evenly and these work. A different size for left and right. Bose quality in construction and sound.
5	:	bose its bose. I was surprised when I first tried them to not be so loud. But after I found out that it was from the settings of my phone.. well.. then I got happy againJ I was in doubt between beats and these. I don???t know how are beats (in ear)and I would wish to compare them but what I can say is that bose delivers everything for what the name is standing for. Very happy with the product.
1	:	"They were great for the first week, now the battery is sporadic. Headphones can be plugged in for 20 minutes and say 100% charge, but within 10 minutes they are dying or plugged in overnight and only reach 50%. Truly truly disappointing. Volume is also way too low....bose support is replacing them, but I have to send them back before they'll send the replacement, so I will be without for at least 7-10 days. Very disappointing. Will likely sell on eBay and replace with another brand"
1	:	"They stopped working moments after i took them out of the box, totally bricked. I tried to do a hard wire update to the firmware and nothing. The worst part is the BOSE customer service, which after I waited My 20 minuets on hold, finally agreed to replace their faulty product. I have 10 dollar pair of blu tooth headphones from target that are more reliable than these. I thought I was paying to not have these kind of issues. if you are looking for an easy to use, no hassle set of blu tooth headphones, look else where"
4	:	"IMHO these headphones are much better than some of the most popular wireless brands and the price is very good for Bose. My only complaint is about customer service, I sent an email to them with questions and never got a response. The headphones and their sound are amazing. I wish support was a little better."
3	:	"Loved the sound and range.  Unfortunately, though, they just stopped working after one year.  Will not charge.  This is the second pair of Bose headphones I have owned.  The first pair failed around the one year mark as well.  Bought again, thinking maybe it was a fluke.  I expect a product that will last in this price range and this brand name.  Will not be buying Bose headphones again."
5	:	"One of the best purchases I've ever made.I've always been annoyed in some way about whatever pair of headphones I've had in the past, and have never had a pair of earbuds that don't constantly fall out- these are endlessly comfortable and the sound is amazing.  The app is great.  ugh I love these.  Been excited all day."
1	:	"For the price this should just work, instead it constantly gives you connection issues and after less than a year the thing is falling apart. Don???t recommend."
2	:	"Power button died in less than 24 hours. Needless to say, I am less than impressed with the durability, especially since they branded this as the new and improved tougher version. 2 stars for accepting the return no questions asked."
3	:	"Like most things - made in wherever, not here - these began to fall apart fairly soon. They still sound great and for running I imagine they are fantastic."
5	:	I've only had these a week or so but I'm in love! They're the updated ones that came out after the recall of the first ones. No savings pricewise but I was lucky to get them before everyone else since they appear to be on back order or something!
1	:	"I bought these Bose Soundsport Wireless Headphones due to their good reviews. I liked the look from pictures, but unfortunately after wearing it, the fitting wasn???t good; it kept falling off even from the other 2 sizes of earbuds. It didn???t look good how the earphone kept popping out of our ear. What a disaster. Don???t buy! Test out your fitting in the Bose Showroom or any electronic stores before purchasing."
5	:	"I bought my husband these for Christmas 2017, it's February and he's still loving them. Wears them all day everyday at work on a construction site to answer calls. He loves that he can pair it to two different phones."
2	:	"Sound quality is good, but the build quality is horrible! One of the shottiest pair of headphones I???ve ever owned. The volume toggle button is silicon or something and falls off after a few months use. The bose symbol fell off on the right side. And the little part covering the charging port doesn???t close anymore to keep dust and all of that out of the port. Would highly recommend a different pair or a protection plan since these will NOT last long."
1	:	"For over 20 years I've been a big fan of Bose products, so when I bought these headphones I had high expectations. Both sound and weight met 100%. Unusually it was the quality which proved disappointing as it lasted less than 4 months !. I read that last year, due to design problems, BOSE replaced equipment manufactured before August 2016, however, I bought them in April 2017 counting that they had solved the problem."
4	:	"Love these headphones! They are perfect for how I like to listen to music (Im not an audiophile, but seriously they sound great). Quick to charge and pair quickly. Sometimes I get a little confused on wether I turned them off or not, I wish there was a different notifier than a sound noise. My only wish is that I would like them to be a little lighter, but with the tech in them its understandable."
3	:	Best sound on the market but they constantly came out of my ears while running. None of the different size ear plugs worked. I ended up returning these and coughing up $200 for Beats wireless.
2	:	Stopped charging fully after just 4 months.  THe indicator when you first turn it on says 100% but after use for 10 minutes says it is only 50%
2	:	"I actually love the headphones, but I had my 1st pair for less than a year when they stopped powering on or charge.  I read through the warranty information and it stated I needed original packaging, which I am sure I finally threw away after 9 months. I took good care of them, the only thing I can imagine is them getting wet when I work out.  That was the reason I bought them though.  Love the sound and the fit but 150.00 for them to not last a year??"
2	:	"These wont stay in my ear!!!  I've only owned Bose audio products over the past 40+ years...I may have to switch to another brand wireless to get something to fit...the sound cant be beat; however, the fit is poor."
5	:	I love these headphones for weight lifting. They're phenomenal. Only thing I wish I could change is if the volume could be made a little higher. The clip that comes with it that's supposed to clip onto your shirt breaks easily though.
2	:	"In less than a year , on/off button got brokenI wasted my money with boseDon???t buy any products from such company"
5	:	Great set of wireless headphones. I've always loved the wired version. These fit well in my ears and they don't fall out when I run. They stay fairly snug and have not fallen out. The sound is great. Base is great.The connection app is pretty easy to use and not complicated. The app has basic functionality when it comes to audio.
5	:	"Its Bose!! what more do I say. It fits as expected, comfortable and I will highly recommend this for all sport activities. I even use this for my office meetings and the audio quality is crystal clear"
1	:	Had to return these Bose SoundSport headphones they were used!!!...Very gross stuff in hear pieces. The box was dirty NOT sealed like new. Enough said.....I went to Best Buy and even upgraded to Bose Quiet 30.
1	:	Waiting and waiting to finally become affordable and these piece of crap cannot go past any volume acceptable. 1-8 are almost mute.... full 10 sound like a9$ pair. THE BIGGEST RIPOFF IN BOSE HISTORY. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. THEY LOST TO ALL THE REST AND TRYING TO DUMP INVENTORY W NEW COLORS. A BOSE LOVER ALL MY LIFE FOR DAY TO DAY STUFF.  X???ed FOREVER. Giving them AWAY. THANKS BOSE ... merry x m??s to YOU
3	:	I have owned this device for approx 7 months and they suddenly stopped working in the middle of a workout.  I made several attempts to turn them back on but there was no indication of functionality even when placed on a charger.  Prior to failure the headset performed well and as advertised.  I believe the failure was sweat related.  I am currently letting the headset dry out and  will attempt to operated them after 24 hrs or so.  $149 is too much money for a device to fail after just 7 months of use.
5	:	"So far so good! I had reservations when deciding to purchase these earphones. Many of the reviews indicated these earphones short out after time due to sweat. I bought these for my husband who sweats a lot when he exercises. He has been wearing them for a few weeks & have not had any issues. The sound quality is amazing! Nothing compares to Bose in that category. They are also surprisingly comfortable & do not fall out of the ear. All I can say is that I know they are much pricier than other earphones, but you really do get what you pay for & these are worth the money. I'll follow up if there are any issues. But so far, that are awesome!!"
5	:	"Best bass, best clarity, very comfortable, firm fitting. Don't buy anything besides these. Absolutely worth the money."
2	:	"After using for 3 months, the voice adjustment case was broken. Have to charge every day, or even twice every day. Not a good product for birthday gift."
4	:	"Like Bose products.  I own a pair of over-the-ears headphones and ear buds and both have the noise cancellation features.  These wireless buds work well, but wish Bose would make a good pair with n/c feature as my other two."
5	:	I love these! They stay in your ear when running and are super comfortable. The sound is amazing! I've had problems with other well known brands that just quit working but not with these! All my Bose products still work and never let me down. I am so glad the finally made these!
5	:	"Bose holds nothing back with these earphones!The Bluetooth range is impressive. The audio quality is fantastic, and the bass is incredible.You will not be disappointed."
2	:	"We love Bose products, but this headphone is no better than many cheaper ones."
1	:	"After 2 months using them I went for a run under the rain. 45 mins into the run and the headphones stopped working. I sent them back for a replacement and received a brand new one (great customer service but it took more than one month to get the new one here in Latin America). Yesterday, I went for a run again under the rain and 30 mins into the run and they stopped working! They were supposed to be waterproof... I'm sending them back again!!"
5	:	Excellent product that performs beyond expectations. I use them for daily workouts and weekend chores and the battery life is amazing. I charge them only after many hours of use. They remain secure during vigorous activity and the sound quality is great. I even leave the phone they connect to in the garage while working in the driveway and the connection remains strong. I have been using them for several months and there???s no degradation in quality. Worth the price and I highly recommend them.
3	:	"** ordered just a week ago, this should be for the updated version **Pros:- easy to connect to your phone (got these for my iPhone7)- button functions are very easy and not cumbersome (e.g.: turning off is just holding the power button for ~3 seconds)- voice feedback- battery life seems pretty decent & they charge quickly- Bose stayhear moldings are AMAZING (reason why I keep coming back to Bose)Cons:- bass distortion- not as loud as the wired onesSummary:The only reason why I'm giving 3 stars is because of how functionally solid this product is. It's minimalist/aesthetically pleasing (compared to other wireless earphones that I've tried), comfortable (I work out with them) and easy to use/pair with your device.I took off two stars because the sound quality is absolutely horrendous compared to the wired version (and other Bose products, for that matter).First off - they're all-around quieter. That's not that big of a deal breaker, but still 1 star off.Second - bass distortion is too great. My go-to song (currently) for my commute/work/workout is ""Reaching Out"" by Bassnectar.I may be a bit of an audiophile because I can't listen to this song at all with these earphones. And it's not just this song either, it's a whole variety of songs that have very deep bass. The sound quality plummets for songs with deep bass; static, crinkling noises start popping up. It's so bad.TL;DRIf you just want something to use day-to-day and don't care too much about audio quality, this is your product.If you listen to bass-heavy music and sound distortion bothers you DON'T GET THESE.Sound quality on wired versions are NOTICEABLY better (I have both)"
4	:	Great quality sound. Ran several half marathons and battery held up great.  They stayed tight in my ears.  The shirt clip tends to fall off a lot would be easy to lose and it's a big part of helping the buds from pulling on ears .
4	:	"Honestly, its a make or a miss. Try them out, you either love them or hate them."
5	:	"These are awesome, no wires to worry about, they???re comfortable, and the sound is awesome. I wear them to the gym and the sweat resistant features are awesome!  Least likely thing about them, I should???ve bought them sooner."
5	:	"I love these headphones! I used them at the gym, running, biking, sitting in an air plane, you name it. The battery life is phenomenal, they stay in my ears easily, and I love the sound quality for both music and calls."
2	:	This product is not built well. I got it in the first place to be able to use it at the gym and at work. But after use (not even a year old) the rubber casing of both earbuds started to pealed off exposing the electronics inside to water damage. Now I only use it at work but it is still hard to use since to turn it on or off I have to use a paper clip. I expected more from BOSE. This headphones are NOT cheap and therefore I expected a high quality item.
5	:	"I have purchased Bose headphones before. Recently I upgraded my iPhone 6sPlus to 8 plus only to find that you have to carry headphone jack attachment. There is not one built in the phone. So, I ordered these and I must say I am very happy with purchase. Sound and sound cancellation is good in gym. I bike in summers so will write an outside review in summers. I have no buyers remorse buying them. They are awesome. I Ike them. Will recommend them to anyone."
4	:	Sounds great and keep a decent charge.  The fit is a little off but always love Bose quality
5	:	Great for running. Ear buds don't fall out and are secured in place.
3	:	The wireless headphones clothing clip broke in 3 months. Bose charges $3.95 for it! They should include and extra one if it is known to break sop easily. Pairing is very easy with Apple devices however Does not pair with my PC (Non-apple) using Windows 10 OS. Sounds good and great for out door use or when working at home.
4	:	"These headphones fit great, sound great, good battery, app is easy to use, and they are heavy duty.No issues with sweat either.Honestly my only gripe and why I don't give 5/5, is that I wish they went slightly louder so I can really bump my tunes. Don't get me wrong, they still go loud, but I want louder."
1	:	"Do NOT buy these headphones. They stopped working after just 3 months of light use. When they worked, they were great--They stayed in my ears and were super comfortable for long runs. However, they lost charge once and although I have recharged them several times, they will not turn on or hold a charge. I checked Bose's website, and there are a ton of complaints about this exact problem. Don't waste your time and money!!"
5	:	"Comfortable fit. I have not had any issues with sweat resistance. I switched to wireless earbuds because all of my previous earbuds seemed to short somewhere in the wires so one side would stop working and the earbud adapter piece for my phone case always broke after prolonged use so I'd remove my case to listen to music (not a good idea--I ended up dropping my phone and cracking my screen). The wires were also annoying when doing things like bent over barbell rows. These are also far more convenient also because I can connect to my laptop and phone at the same time. And I have no problem with the volume--maybe because I updated the software through the connect app soon after I got them and the update fixed the issue?Another note: I was split between these and the new Jaybirds because I really liked the idea of being able to set my own custom equalizer. After getting these, I realized many music apps (like Spotify) allow you to set your own EQ anyway. So, it's actually not a big deal.Pros:Definitely stay in earsAbsolutely incredible sound (bass and all, hardstyle electronic to indie acoustic)Good connection--I have yet to measure how far but I can walk a decent distance away from my device before it disconnects and it has absolutely no problems with my phone when it's across my bodyLook goodCons:Pricy (but worth it)A separate note on battery life:These seem to have a pretty good battery life compared to other earbuds I've read about. I have never used earbuds that require charging, so I'm still getting used to it, but the charge does last a long time and they charge quickly.Overall I am very happy with these and would recommend them to a friend."
5	:	"Great sound, good fit even with my small ears. The only complaint is when I have to answer the phone. I haven't figured out how to do that very well yet. But they have a good battery life and are very comfortable."
5	:	"A wonderful wireless headphone - it fits very well and provides one of the best sound quality. The headphone paired with my iPhone pretty easy, streams well and the call quality is great too. Though it looks bulky I don't find it heavy or any discomfort. Sometimes the headphone comes off the ear when I wear a coat - it is mostly due to the wire get stuck in the collar or on my shoulder bag - not a design issue.It is bit expensive but I guess it is worth for the quality for all other headphones I checked.In short, loving it - just I need to workout more to fulfill its purpose ;)"
5	:	Great for jogging. Fast connection. Last for about 4 workouts.
2	:	Pros - good profile.  Fits well.  Comfortable and sweat resistantCons. Battery last two hours.  Sound is 5 out of 10.  Ability to register warranty on website or via phone was not possible.
1	:	"UPDATE: These were great.  Sound was great, weight, ease of use, fit.  Now, four months in, they have died.  This product is too expensive to stop working after such a short time."
5	:	"Wow. These are so very good. Comfortable, sound great, very good noise cancelling, and easy to pair. Long lasting charge makes these the best I've owned and I've owned lots!"
1	:	After using the product around 6 months the plastic cover and connectors started to fall apart as you can see in the pictures. I???ve had Biden sound sport devices for a while and always have issues with them.
1	:	"I really did like these headphones - good sound quality, comfortable, etc. However, calling them sweat proof is simply false. Over the last month, 3 pairs of these headphones have broken on me. There's a well known manufacturing defect that causes them to break on account of sweat.  Each time they've broken, I've contacted Bose. Bose sent me new headphones each time (through their service center in Brazil) - each pair had the same defect. The last two pairs stopped working within a week.  Bose claims the defect has been fixed, but I have no reason to believe that."
5	:	I bought a set for my wife Christmas last year and had to get another set for myself because they sounded so good. They fit great and are well worth the money.
5	:	Great sounds and fit. Battery life is really great too
5	:	"These wireless headphones are nothing short of amazing! Holds a charge for a long time. Crystal clear sound and somewhat noise blocking. Easy to use and easy to charge. Comes with a clip that will let you attach the cord to your collar if you wish, also has a handy little case that can clip on to your purse strap or belt loop!"
5	:	"Amazing earbuds.  Much better fit and sound than Jaybirds.  Actually the sound is amazing and even better than beats, any version, which have been my go to earbuds for the last 4 years.  Between running, biking and other outdoor activities, they stay snug in my ears.  No issues with sweating either.  I live in the Deep South, so you always have to deal with humidity and copious amounts of sweat, these earbuds handle it with no issues.  I would highly recommend."
3	:	"Bought these and they worked great - nothing earth shattering but are definitely a solid pair of wireless headphones. I like the sound and they were just what I wanted to gym use. But the battery stopped working and eventually was totally defective (and would no longer turn on without being connected to power). That is the only complaint I have and, thus, the reason for the 3 star review..."
5	:	"The sound is great and the comfort is way better than I expected. I had been using some budget bluetooth headphones, which were okay until they shorted out due to sweat. I was worried about comfort on these since they look similar to the cheap ones I was using - but these are amazing. They are so soft but stay perfectly in my ears. Every day I run for 30 minutes and lift weights for 30 minutes - have never had a problem. The signal has never dropped, even when walking clear across the gym (~80ft) from my phone (iPhone 7). They're pricey, which made it difficult to buy, but I don't regret it now."
4	:	"Less battery life than most Bluetooth devices. Popping sound can be heard every few minutes. I still like them, but wonder if I would be better off without any wires."
3	:	"Worked really well while they lasted, great sound and would not fall out when I'd be playing basketball or doing other sweaty activities. However, they broke after about 7 months while using them probably around 15 hours a week: there's no indicator light when I plug it in to the charger and I can't turn it on. In the few weeks before it finally stopped working it would randomly disconnect or be unable to connect to my phone. So worth purchasing if you want a pair of earphones that will last you about 7 months."
3	:	"Sound quality is good, much better than several other brands of wireless earphones I tried.Comfortable to wear.Battery life is not very long lasting."
3	:	"When trying them on in my house, they sounded great. But while using them outside on a run, they don't sound good or stay in my ears. I was getting a lot of wind noise as well which was annoying. These might be good if your working out inside of a gym but again not sure because of the inability to cancel out noise around you. This fit might work for some people but I normally need something that wraps around my ears or covers them completely because of my ear shape."
5	:	"These are the most amazing headphones. I swim almost every day. When I put these on and listen to the music, you would think you are in a concert hall. Using these headphones has allowed me to increase my distances and time swimming for a far better workout. Stunning sound!"
1	:	"Worst headphones ever!Started software update indicate by Bose App and now the headphones do not work!Nothing works now, it is just a piece of cable, plastic and useless buttons.Just talked to Bose support and they could not resolve the issue either."
3	:	Sound quality is amazing and they're extremely comfortable. Reason I'm giving 3stars is because I've had them for less than a year and they're not working anymore. I'm guessing water damage from sweat
5	:	"Great fit, they don???t slip out of your ears like a lot of other earphones. I wear them to the gym and they stay out the entire time. Great bass for earphones and good battery life, especially for the size."
2	:	"The battery stopped keeping a charge after 30 days. Finally got Amazon to replace. The sound is ok, but they do not block out enough noise and won't get loud enough. Not worth the price."
5	:	"I have finally found my wireless headphones.  They sound amazing, they are insanely comfortable, and they have been reliable (so far).  My seemingly endless quest for a pair of wireless headphones has ended ( I have tried and returned about 10 different popular pairs).  Could not recommend these more."
5	:	"These are excellent, I also bought the jaybirds they do not even compare.They are not good for phone conversations, they pick up everything. But work great for sports and music."
5	:	"Best wireless headphones.  Had over 4 pairs of Beats wireless that were replaced / bought again and no problems with these, have had them for awhile and wear them 5-7 times per week for 1-2 hours.  Have to charge after wearing twice.  Fit in ear well, great sound quality.  LOVE."
5	:	"These buds fit in your ears very comfortably and stay put, even during a physical days work. They with stand the elements. They have amazing sound! Bose definitely lived up to their name when they made these! Had a pair of Beats before these that didn???t last nearly long as these and didn???t have nearly the quality as the Bose does. I would definitely recommend the Bose to anyone and would purchase them again."
5	:	I highly recommend these headphones.  I use them when running.  The sound quality is amazing and the earbuds don't slip out of my ear.  Bose customer service is amazing.  These earbuds died on me when running and Bose replaced them without a hassle.  Highly recommend!
3	:	Beautiful sound and fit ear buds but very disappointed on quality the glue that holds these air buds together after 6 months of hard use doesn't hold up very well it's all ready falling apart on me and this is the 2nd pair this has happened to ... Bose fix your glue.....
5	:	"Been using these for about 2 months now and they are just superb.  I use them to take calls, while running, and just listening to music throughout  the day.Connectivity is a breeze, battery life is great, in ear fit is the best I've used so far from any headphone like this - no problems staying with falling out during exercise.  And, sound quality is sublime."
4	:	"Gave these as a gift, but I have a pair as well. Only drawback is they tend to drop a connection briefly (1 sec) periodically which is annoying."
5	:	"Good sound quality, good job of noise cancelling, battery level shows up on Iphone so you know the exact battery level. The ear fit is very comfortable, you'll forget you even have them in your ears."
5	:	These things are awesome !! Great sound
5	:	"These earbuds are fantastic. Great sound and very comfortable when I'm working out. You never know how annoying cords are until you don't have them anymore.One thing I want to recommend is if people are having audio problems, such as skipping or static, make sure you are on a 5.0 ghz network (WiFi). If you are connected to a 2.5 ghz network (WiFi) you will get some interference because wireless earbuds run on a 2.5 ghz frequency."
3	:	"These have been great for my daily commute (walking, mass transit), the gym, and lunch breaks at work. The Bluetooth connection is strong and the sound is great. I love them! However, over the last few months, the battery life has gotten worse and worse. Today, a full charge didn't even last a 30-minute lunch. In about a week I expect these things to be completely dead. I had great headphones for a year, and now they're nearly useless."
4	:	"Sound quality is good when listening to music. However I purchased them for phone use and they???re not very good in this area when in a vehicle with the windows down, which defeats the purpose of my purchase. With prolonged use (3+ hours) they start hurting my ears due to the weight. But they are Bose which makes listening to music with them invaluable."
3	:	"After much research I decided to go with the soundsport. It stays in the ears fairly well, has a decent charge time, and seems resistant to sweat.The Negative:This headphone is too quiet. After 4 months the part that keeps it in your ears started to soften causing the earbuds to fall out mid workout. 6 months in the charge is unreliable and there is static in the left earbud.Because of the negatives I can only give it 3 out of 5 stars."
4	:	"Fits in ears decently, sound is nice clip on the back doesn???t work and battery life isn???t great."
2	:	"One my second pair.  My first pair wouldn't charge at all.  I contacted Bose and they sent a replacement pair.  I have been charging them for hours, and they say it is fully charged with a green light, and says 100%, but after I turn them off then back on, they say only at 50-60%."
5	:	"These stay in really well, connect easily, and the battery lasts long enough that I only need to charge them every few days. I generally wear them for 15 minutes to 2 hours per day. I've never had complaints that people have difficulty hearing me when using them for conversation."
1	:	"I've had these for 8 months. Had been thrilled with them but recently they have completely stopped working. Bluetooth light is solid green all the time (this is not indicated as a possible state in the support documentation). When plugged into wall charger the battery light will flash Amber for a short time then go solid green, but will not power not power on and I no longer hear the voice prompts indicating battery, on/off status, etc ..."
3	:	Pretty good product! About 1 year into owning these I noticed the rubber lining for the volume control rocker switches has either come untucked or ripped from the volume control housing. It looks like its ripped as what looks like a portion to be tucked back in is too short for long term. I use these ear buds probably once or twice a week. Its just a matter of time now till the internal board for the rocker switch becomes wet and useless. Is $150 for 1 years use ok with you?
5	:	outstanding bose sound. Fits very comfortably. Stays put even during an intense workout. The only thing i do not like is the size + Shape + material of the volume controller. Battery could be better also
5	:	"Aside from the always super fancy Bose packaging, these things are amazing. They're pretty much dead when delivered, but charge super quick. Like 50% charge in 10 mins. Not sure I could ever use anything else. Come w/ a few different size ear inserts, big ones work best for myself. Complete privacy when using them, crank them up and in the zone. Work well when you're drenched in sweat too. I'm an avid gym goer, great not having to keep my iPod connected to me, complete body movement."
3	:	Battery is terrible. After 2 months the  headphones now only retain a charge for about 10 minutes. Even after it is charged to 100% it runs down to 20% in 5 minutes and tells you the battery is low. 5 minutes. Not acceptable obviously. Very disappointed.UPDATE: Just called Bose Customer Service. They could not have been nicer. Replacement set is being processed. No questions asked. Now I am very impressed. Thank you Bose.
5	:	"Short version: Even Bose bluetooth still can't match a high end wired set for pure sound quality/volume, but these are by far the best wireless buds out there.Long version:To start with, these are insanely comfortable. Like, wear them from 6am to 6pm and totally forget they're there (taking them out to charge at lunch) comfortable. And they do not fall out, period.Audio profile is quintessential Bose. Warm and full with decent bass, accurate mids and clear highs. The volume will go high enough to hurt without distortion or digital squeal, and the person next to you won't hear a thing. Low volume performance is also good, allowing just enough outside noise in for situational awareness without muddling the source audio.Call quality is fantastic on both ends and the bluetooth connection is rock solid with my S7 whether I'm sitting next to a Server/UPS room in a building chock-full of wireless signals, or driving under power lines that would make my Gear IconX cut out every time.Battery life is as good as it gets without adding bulk or sacrificing sound quality/volume, and recharging takes no time. A full charge over night and a 1/2 hour at lunch will keep them going through heavy, all day use.The buds come with small, medium and large tips, and finding the right combination is key to getting the best experience. Try each matching set and start with the one that gives the fullest sound, then adjust individually as needed. Upsize if they feel loose or sound weak, and downsize if you experience any ear fatigue throughout the day. I ended up with the large in my left ear, and the medium in my left. Perfection...These can't quite match a good set of wired buds with foam tips for pure isolation and quality, but for daily drivers, they're hard to beat."
5	:	Best earbuds I've ever owned corded or not. These bad boys will leave your ears feeling like they've entered into a realm meant for the gods. I knew Bose was one of the best but I didn't expect this product to deliver me into a world of pure bliss. Deep bass. Highs and mids are perfect. You will not be disappointed with these.
5	:	These were my first pair of wireless ear phones and they did not disappoint! The sound quality is amazing! They also do not skip out of your ears when you are running or at the gym. Very happy with my purchase.
3	:	"Great sound, I had intermittent heart rate connections regardless of earpiece size used, and even though it transmits the same Bluetooth version, my elliptical wouldn???t pair with the ear buds. It was not advertised that the earbuds would pair with the device, but was my assumption since they were both using the same version."
5	:	"Aw yeah, loving these!! comfortable, cord length is right, battery is good about 6-8 hrs (don't use that Bose app if you want your full battery time) they sound great. Stay put and are comfortable."
1	:	"They simply aren't designed to stay in your ear for a workout. They might stay in my ears if I was sitting at a desk while using them, so I'm not sure why they're suggested for activity. I tried all three rubber in ear options, but there's no part of them that will actually keep them in your ears."
5	:	"I love these headphones, I've been strictly a Bose headphones customer for about 6 years now, and each pair has been better than the last.  These have a great battery life, lasting me more of less the entire work day.  Bose customer service is topnotch as well, any time I've had an issue they've been quick to respond, and replace defective products.  Stop second guessing and buy these."
5	:	Find the correct sized Ear piece & enjoy superb spund quality akin to Bose. The mic is very good even when speaking in crowded environment. We gave up atleast 3 of our last bluetooth headsets owing to poor mic quality.
5	:	Very nice. The battery lasts 5 to 6 hours. Very easy to connect and to answer call phones.  No noise cancellations but the sound is very clear.
4	:	Is hard to say anything bad about these headphones besides what many have already said about them which is battery life. 5 hours is halfway enough when you go to the gym every day as well as run every day. Sometimes you get 5 hours. Sometimes you get 3. I've made it a routine to charge them every day after I'm done.
1	:	Bought these in Dec so I haven???t even had them for 5 months and they are not working properly. They are cutting out and worst of all my caller sometimes sounds like they???re under water and my voice sounds like I swallowed helium. Very disappointed in quality.
4	:	"***Update 5/9/17***After about 5 months of consistent use (5-6 times per week), I started having issues with the volume as well as not being able to power the unit off. It go to the point that I contacted Amazon and got them  replaced for free and quickly. My initial review gave the headphones five stars.  I'm taking a star off due to the recent issues i've had. This does not take away from how much i enjoy using these headphones. I still stand by my previous review. These are well worth the price tag, and with a return and replace policy like Amazon's, the inconvenience was minor at best.Excellent headphones The sound quality is excellent, and unlike the JayBirds, these stay in my ears; comfortably. The comfort fit wing tips are soft and can't be felt when wearing the headphones. Some reviews will say they are big and unsightly; I don't think so. Overall, I'm happy with these headphones and are well worth the price."
5	:	"The sound is great (obviously)! But more importantly, these actually stay in your ears too! I have tried so many cheaper headphones that fall right out as soon as I start running."
2	:	Poor quality. Falling apart in just 8 months
5	:	I love these wireless bluetooth headphones. They are comfortable and great for activity. You cant go wrong with BOSE.
5	:	"So excited to get these awesome earphones! Amazing sound quality. The product quality is also great, wires are of great material and not thin. Fits perfectly in the ears. Just love this product. The package contains a pair of earphones, charging cable, extra sets of earplugs (Small and Large sizes, as the Medium size is already fir into the earphones) and a small portable pouch for carrying your earphones."
1	:	I have used many Bose products and have been happy with them. This headphone is supposed to be sweat and weather resistant. But the area near the on/off button has popped open and sweat and water go inside. Must be a design problem. It is just overpriced and and over hyped. I wish I could return it.
1	:	"You would think a product with the word ???sport??? in the name would be usable during athletic activities. However, at the slightest jostle (when I, got example, run or jog), the left earphone falls out. I???ve tried all the different sized ear pieces that came with them and all different combinations of wire clipping and position, and still it falls out. I???ve been a loyal bose customer for over a decade but this product is making me question that."
1	:	"after using it for a couple of months, it suddenly stopped working, doesn't charge, doesn't switch on, nothing! I have tried lots of Bose products, I trust the brand but this item failed me!"
2	:	Update nov 2018: this thing pretty beat up in one year.Battery is not accurate in percentage as sometimes it says 100% but doesn't last much
5	:	so far so good been running with and working out but then again i only have it for a month...  I love it the sound is incredible and it does keep the noise out from coming in. I WOULD RECOMMENDED
4	:	"They did not fit very well in my ears. I haven't used them yet for running, but I m quite sure they will fall off. Note that I have very big ears.The sound quality is great. It definitely out scores any low cost headphones by far. But I still question whether they really worth it that amount of money."
5	:	"These are great for exercise.  Excellent sound and good bass for when you are outside and there is a lot of noise.  They aren't noise canceling but the in-ear design delivers good sound, and they sit firmly in your ear even when running or walking.  The mic works well on phone calls, too."
4	:	"LOVE MY BOSE HEADPHONES!! Definitely nice quality sound and decent battery life. Negative is the clip for the headphones comes off easily, so it could come lose and it might not be noticed until too late."
2	:	"Great Bose sound and earbuds are comfortable, but they fall out relatively easily due to bulky size/shape. The battery life is awful! I bought them during Black Friday last year for $99. I'm barely getting an hour off one charge now. I haven't used them that much. Incredibly disappointing product from Bose, I've been a loyal customer for years. My wired earbuds were spectacular."
5	:	"Good device and good battery life. I wasn't sure if the aqua color was going to be good for me, but it actually looks really good, this color has more life than the black one in my opinion."
5	:	I own both beats and this one.  Beats is a good product but this bose beats it in sound quality and connectivity.  I would get disruptions with the beats.  I havent really gotten any disruptions with Bose.  The beats is a little more secure on your ear but sucks when you need to use sunglasses with it.
2	:	"These seemed promising but have been a disappointment. The main issues are with product quality.First, I use the product mainly for phone calls. It frequently disconnects from my iPhone and does not pick up calls directly when connected (I have to push multiple buttons to connect).Second, the product is literally falling apart. The trim around the outside of the headset is coming off and the on / off button literally fell off somewhere."
5	:	Gonna make it short and sweet. Sound quality is top notch and the fit is great. If you're questioning if they are worth $149. Don't. They are worth every dollar. They stay in your ear very well.
3	:	"Great sound and easy user interface but these buds are a bit bulky and heavier than I'd like.  While the ear grips are solid, I find the weight of the buds are a bit much.  The buds extend out from the ear far enough to dislodge itself from the ear.  I also find that the cord gets caught on my neck, especially when sweaty, so if I turn my head the buds also can come dislodged.  These are expensive buds - like I said the sound is great, just have not had the best experience during sports activities."
5	:	I am a Bose fan so I would just write good stuff. I owe many products and they all are the best sound you can get. It is not tiny as a headset but great material and the battery works fine. Like for every time I go run 35 to 45 min and the usage is 10%In 10 days I need to charge.
5	:	Great wireless headphones. Sound is great. I also use for cell phone calls. Very happy with this product. It changed the way I run. Recommend for currently wired ear bud runners!
5	:	"Great sound, Bose of course. Good battery life. I get a few gym sessions out of them at a time. They also charge quickly. Usually takes less than an hour to fully charge."
5	:	"Pros:1. Bose sound quality.2. Multipoint bluetooth. Can connect to 2 devices at the same time and switch automatically (little lag but tolerable)3. Superb sync with phone, Siri activable from earphones controls.4. Better than Airpods (except airpods are truly wireless)Cons:Sound quality may not be as good as Bose QC35. But, for the price its good."
5	:	Love these headphones. So easy to pair with my IPhone and IPad. I have small ears and have returned quite a few headphones due to ear buds falling out. The Bose fit perfectly and very comfortable. Some people have mentioned that volume does not go up that high but I find the sound perfect. I recommend the headphone highly.
5	:	"Headphones work as described, and I use them in the rain. Sound quality is great as well as blue tooth technology"
3	:	"Sennheiser didn't make a set of wireless earbuds and AKG was bought by Samsung so that left Bose. After six months with them I have to say that they are average, they're worth about a third of what they cost."
5	:	"The bose soundsport is  better, in my opinion, than my jaybird x2 due to a better fit in the ear/staying in the ear and slightly better sound quality. Some reviews have said that the soundsport is a heavy at the ears and that the long cable gets annoying when running. I found both of these claims to not be true in my experience."
5	:	"What I was hoping for. I like Bose sound, and these fit nicely in my ears. I don???t like earbuds and the compression fit in the ear. These nestle securely and comfortably."
5	:	"Great sound, comfortable to wear, and connects easily to my bluetooth devices."
1	:	"Sound is great but not comfortable at all compared to Beoplay I had...,m Wiore it for 5 minutes and my ears hurt-not good"
2	:	"They don't stay put. If you touch them ever so slightly, they fall out. Sound is okay, but they look ridiculous sticking out of you head like that."
2	:	I love the sound that they give clean and clear sound quality. My main problem is they only start with battery at 80% and from there they may last an hour or two. For the price I paid I was expecting more or better quality. Would have sent them back but I missed the cut off date before I really started using them.
4	:	"Purchased for daughters gym use. She used another VERY popular EXPENSIVE brand that just ""died"" after 3 months.She very happy with these! Sweat resistant, durable, sound quality is fantastic!"
1	:	"If I could give zero stars, I would. These headphones are FAKE Bose headphones and it???s very clear. The range is terrible, the packaging is clearly inauthentic, and the plastic starting breaking off one of the sides of my headphones after owning these for 2 months, and they won???t pair with the BOSE app because they aren???t a BOSE product. I???m doing everything I can to get a refund from this company. Very unhappy with these fake headphones especially since I paid $120 for them."
2	:	"Great sound interrupted regularly by audio cutouts. Disappointing for this expensive item.Comfortable to wear, but not secure in your ears."
3	:	"I purchased these a few months after buying my iPhone 7 and after reading up on several bluetooth headsets. I wasn't interested in waiting for Apple's new bluetooth headphones as I don't like the design of the wired equivalents that are packed in with the phone as it is, and i'd previously been primarily relying on my Bose QC20i's, which I could no longer use without an adapter (I have yet to use an adapter that doesn't break within a few weeks).I settled on these headphones for a few reasons:1. I've owned many Bose headphones over the years and have yet to find another pair that matches them in audio quality for my use cases (music while in transit, music while working out, listening/talking on conference calls and videoconferences).2. I wasn't super interested in having headphones consisting of a solid ""collar"" with earbuds connected by wires.3. Bose headphones seem to fit best into my ear canal. I hate earphones that consist of a cylinder you stick in your ear.4. I opted for this model (the HR model) because I thought it would augment my Apple watch with some additional heart rate information while working out.After using them extensively for all of my use cases, i'd rate them at about a 3.5 out of 5. (Choosing a 3 since I can't choose a half-star, and I don't think they are a 4). Here's why:- I don't need the heart rate functionality (there doesn't seem to be a way to use both the Apple Watch and these headphones, at least not with the apps I use). When I have attempted it to use it, I find that my headphones frequently become dislodged, at which point the headphones are constantly asking me to adjust one earbud or the other (usually the left) - that is beyond annoying. Had I chosen the non-HR version, I could have used the extra hour of battery life.- The quality is good, but I can still tell the difference between these and my QC20i's - these sound a little more ""digitized"". It's good enough, but i'd love to see it get closer to the wired headphones.- As far as pairing goes, they have been pretty good - you can pair to multiple devices and it seems to auto-connect when you expect it to.- The microphone seems to be great - no issues on calls.- Because the battery(ies?) are in the earbuds, they do stick out quite a bit, which can look a bit weird, and can cause them to become slightly dislodged.Overall, these are decent for heavy use. Had I gone with the non-HR version i'd probably give them a 4. I'm hoping that future revisions have slightly less bulky earbuds and slightly better audio quality."
5	:	"Whoa, these are awesome. BEAUTIFUL sound, fit well, and great controls. I had two Plantronic Backbeat Fits and after the second one broke, I decided to upscale a tad to these Bose Headphones. Great controls, soft and easy on the ears, and Bose-quality sound. Highly recommended."
4	:	"Almost perfect.  The fit is good, the sound is excellent.  They occasionally lose connection with my phone (not often, but annoying just the same) and the heart rate monitor doesn't work as consistently as I would like."
5	:	"Good sound, stays in at the gym, doesn't allow sweat to get into the ears (that's been a problem with other headphones for me). I don't wear when running, so I'm not sure how that works"
4	:	"I love to skateboard with these. No wires to get in the way, quality sound. However, they are a bit bulky, and they fall out of my ears sometimes when I'm doing a trick. The clip on the back is important to keep them on."
5	:	"If you are looking for in ear, wireless, sleek, lightweight, headphones that will stay in place while working out, running, etc. then these are it! Absolutely in love with these headphones. Bose outdone themselves, as usual. I was getting so frustrated with in ear headphones and how they would always fall out while I was at the gym running, on the elliptical, etc. with these that is not a concern anymore! Absolutely in love with these and will recommend to anyone and everyone! Job well done Bose."
2	:	"Personally I love these headphones, great sound quality and construction of the headphone. However, the battery life after about a month is pathetic. When they are charged up to 100% they only last a couple of hours, not like they are advertised. Makes it kind of disappointing."
2	:	"I bought these on Feb. 21, 2017 and they have already stopped working as of June 12, 2017. The sound quality is great but they slowly start to die faster and faster until they finally stop working."
4	:	"Nice sound and these really do stay in place during a workout. The mini USB power cord broke right where the cord attaches to the USB part and that was with minimal use, proper storage, etc. That was disappointing. I've only had these for a little more than 3 months. Otherwise good."
2	:	"The performance of the product is fine, but after only 9 months, the on/off button has come off and makes it very difficult to turn on/off.  Also, the Bose plastic piece on one side has fallen off, so the durability of these is awful.  I would expect more from a Bose product."
5	:	Love these!  I had a pair of over the ear behind the neck headphones for over 10 years and these are great!  They stay in my ears when jogging which is terrific.  Sound quality is rich and full.  I have nothing bad to say about these.
5	:	After almost two weeks with these headphones I'm VERY impressed. Excellent sound. Easy pairing. Comfortable. All you could ask for in a wireless Bluetooth headphone set. Bought primarily for workouts I now use these all day at work and around the house. Highly recommend.
5	:	"Got these for my boyfriend and he loves them. The sound quality is rich and they???re perfect for his workouts at the gym as well as for his marathon training runs. As soon as they are opened, just make sure to download the latest firmware update through the Bose website to optimize battery life and sound. Seeing how much he loves them has compelled me order a pair for myself!"
3	:	"The earphone offers very good sound quality and long enough battery life for my usage. But the rubber casing started falling apart after 6 months of using... It doesn't affect me as much since I don't really need the waterproof aspect of this earphone. But still, this is not the build quality I would expect for the amount of money I've paid for."
1	:	"the one I revived have charging issue. When I plug charger in, the orange light start blinking for several minutes and turned green. After I left it charging for several hours it still says 30% battery. And I can only use my headphone for 2 hours. It keep happening and I can never get it fully charged... Requested for replacements, will update when recieve the new one."
5	:	"Go to earbuds for the gym or a run. Light weight, secure fit, good sound, you can hear the traffic if you???re running outside, good battery life. I have no complaints."
2	:	"I ran the Chicago marathon and these were great through 300 miles of training and the race. In my 4:42.11 run, only 50% of the battery was used! However 5 days later I tried to use them and they won't turn on. I've charged them for 24 hours and still won't turn on. Hopefully they will recover soon because I'd like to keep using these pricey headphones!"
1	:	"I gave the Bose one star because, after just 3 months, the headphones no longer hold a charge.  I listened to them at the gym, for an hour, 4 times per week.  I never abused, overcharged or damaged them.  A 100% charge will disapate to 20% while just sitting in it's case.  This is a design flaw and I will never buy a Bose product again."
3	:	Great product. Sound is great for an earbud. The clip could have been much stronger. It kept falling off when not attached to the ear. Eventually fell off during a run and trampled on.
5	:	After purchasing several cheaper pairs of Bluetooth headphones and hated them! Finally bought the Bose and am very happy!!! Quality sound several hours of listening and also works great for cell phone use. Very happy
4	:	"This is one of many Bose products i've owned and of course the sound is amazing. The power button is a little hard to press down, for all the old people i suggest something else."
2	:	I really wanted to like these headphones. They sounded amazing! The ISSUE I had with them was they hurt my ears after about 30 minutes of wearing them. The pressure of the blade that keeps them in place began to hurt. After several minutes I had to remove them I tried all 3 sizes and the only one that fit were the ones that were uncomfortable..the medium ones. I had to return them
4	:	"Device turns on by itself.  When it syncs to your phone and it turns on by itself, you can???t hear your phone ring"
5	:	"Love these headphones.  I have bought many cheaper versions of bluetooth headphones to workout and they just don't hold and they break easily. These are a little on the pricier side, but they are worth it.  I have mine for close to two years and they still work and sound great.  This is why I bought my wife a pair as well."
5	:	"I have had these now for 1 month.  While they aren't the best in any category, they are an extreme value!Pros:Extremely comfortableGreat sound qualityDecent Bass (with proper fitting ear pieces)Plenty of volumeDecent sound isolationIncredible batteryEasy Bluetooth pairingFully charge in 2-3 hoursCons:A little bulkyNot great for phone use in noisy areas (mic picks up all ambient noise)Short warning before battery dies (about 5 min)No indicator on phone of battery charge statusTook a little getting used to learning how to put them onThe power button (multi function button) is easily pressed when in the storage case, by simply squeezing the case.Comfort:More than any other feature of these headphones their comfort is what really stands out.  Typically, I don't like over the ear design, but these don't bother me at all.  When I first took them out of the package I was surprised how soft the material is that goes over the ear.  They are so soft that it's surprising that they serve any purpose, but somehow there is just enough to keep the somewhat bulky earpieces in you ear and stable regardless of your activity level.  Full disclosure, I am not very active with these, but stay comfortably in position while doing hours of yard work.Sound Quality:A little background on me.  I have 18 years of designing, selling, installing & training retail sales teams in audio video systems.  I not claiming to be an expert, but I'm comfortable with saying that I have more experience in doing audio reviews than most.  While headphones have never been a focus of mine, they are designed to replicate the experience of listening to speakers &/or live music, of which have been my primary focus.  The best headphones, generally speaking, are an over the ear design & wired (often utilize a headphone amp too).  The SoundWhiz don't have either of these features so their performance needs to be judged on a different scale.  For being wireless and an in ear design, their sound quality is impressive.  Once you have the correct fitting ear pieces installed they have really nice bass reproduction and combined with their ample volume they are really good at over coming noisy environments.  I have enjoyed these while mowing the lawn & using my noisiest tools in my wood shop.  Although, I was surprised at the wind noise that was able to come through.  These headphones use noise isolation as compared to noise cancellation (like many Bose headphones).  I, personally, do not like cancellation.  It has a tendency to ""color"" the music.  It is an imperfect science that adds a hiss to the background of music.  It may be imperceptible to many and is definitely easier to hear with certain kinds of music.  You should also remember that noise cancellation is active meaning it uses battery power.  While I do think the technology has it's possibilities, it's not worth the extra cost in the initial purchase price or the drain on the battery.Phone use:My mother seems to be particularly annoyed with not being able to hear people on the phone, so when she gave me the seal of approval I was thrilled.  Though, that was from my quiet living room.  I tried again from a noisy van traveling at highway speeds and she was not as thrilled.  She was able to hear me fine as long as I raised my voice.  The noise canceling capabilities of my Jawbone ERA is much better.Battery:I was skeptical of the claim to 6 - 8 hour battery life, but feel that is a very accurate statement.  I have not had the chance to run them from fully charged to dead while listening to music, but hey did last me a long road trip.  I'd bet I put a least 6 hours of use in the 14 hours of road time!  I was able to charge the battery in a very respectable 2-3 hours.  I didn't notice exactly when the red light switched to blue to indicate they were fully charged.  It was somewhere between 2-3 hours, I think.  Be careful to not accidentally turn on the headphones when they are in the storage case.  The headphones are turned on/off by pressing the multi function button for a couple seconds.  The case has some structure.  Enough to protect the product, but not enough rigidity to prevent accidentally powering.Other headphones I have:Grado SR-80i - $99 - Over the ear & wired -??Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone (Discontinued by Manufacturer)Klipsch X-10i - $350 - In ear & wired - similar product??Klipsch Image X10 Noise-Isolating Earphone (Discontinued by Manufacturer)Blue Ant Pump - $50 - In ear & wireless -??BlueAnt Wireless PUMP-BL Pump Wireless HD Sportbuds - BlueI purchased these on an Amazon Lightning promotion for $33.99.  I have seen these priced recently for $40 - $45.  While these headphones do have some short comings, even at the higher price these are still an incredible value.  By the way, the performance of the SoundWhiz headphones smoked the Blue Ant Pump in every way and nearly has the comf"
5	:	"I have purchased several different types of sport wireless Bluetooth ear buds, and these actually work perfectly and feel great, (Once I switched to the soft memory foam adapter pieces from the plethora of accessories they gave me from which to choose! AWESOME!!) It's the little things, like the details of the adjustable ear pieces, that make for great products. People's inner ear canals are as different as fingerprints, and the ability to tailor your fit with all the various pieces given, makes them extremely comfortable. Then add to that the deep base response, incredible highs and lows, I'm jamming all the time now with zero fatigue to my ear. Great job Guys.... I'm extremely satisfied!!"
5	:	"You never really truly know what to expect with the product you've purchased until you actually receive it and see it for yourself.  Even with all the reviews and whatever little research you can do to find out as much about a certain product as you can, you will never know until you buy it and see it for yourself.  But with as many good enough reviews as this one had I couldn't ignore it.I recently returned two different bluetooth earbuds and decided to give this one a try.  And let me tell you now.  These have exceeded my expectations.The cable length isn't too long and still can be used without the cable manager but everyone's head is shaped differently and neck length is different so it's good to have one just in case.  I'm using it now and have found a sweet spot of what length to keep it at.  The ear hook is very comfortable and I prefer the foam tips and am very glad they had that option.The sound is superb and even when it might feel the earpiece is getting a little loose the sound never fades and the bass is still the same.  I'm a bass head and so the bass on these are more then ok.Build quality is really up there with the $100 plus earbuds and wouldn't be able to tell that these were under $50.Definitely sweat proof.  I haven't submerged them but I'll have to wait til that happens to see if they really are IPX7 as it describes.Perfect for the gym, running, working out in general.  I love that the controls are built into the earpiece.  I always had problems with the controls being on the cord because it always got in my face.  You don't have to worry about that with these.  buttons are placed conveniently all on the right earpiece for easy access.Calls were very clear on both ends.Overall these are a definite 10!!!"
5	:	"Bought these July 12th. It is now August 4th and though fully charged, they will not turn on. I have contacted SoundWhiz today to see what the potential problem is. I use them for my morning run and it says they are sweat proof, so not sure what the deal is. I am giving this rating until I hear back from SoundWhiz. I loved them up to the point that they stopped working. They were comfortable and had good sound. Hoping my problem will be diagnosed and fixed by them.Update: The company contacted me and will be sending out a replacement set. I will update when I get it. They have been very quick responding and very nice.Update: Got my replacement headphones today and I am very satisfied. Great customer service!"
5	:	"I???m extremely impressed by these headphones. I???m a student who exercises regularly and wanted the best bang for her buck. Here???s why I am happy with this purchase:1) Great sound quality, especially for the price. It sounds significantly better than my Apple earbuds. Does it sound as great as my Bose QC35s? No, but this is about 1/10 of the price and are built for active lifestyles- not sitting on an airplane or in the library. But I do think the sound quality is good enough on this set to serve as great everyday headphones in multiple settings and for casual use. Additionally, the headphones do feel a bit light/fragile but in my somewhat extensive experience with Bluetooth headphones designed for exercise it???s par for the course. I???ve dropped them a few times and haven???t had any issues, so they do seem sturdy enough.2) Comes with a lot of cool gizmos. I have come to the conclusion that I had very oddly shaped ears that have a hard time retaining any sort of earbud. HOWEVER: Soundwhiz includes not 1, not 2, not 3, but rather SIX sets of interchangeable earbud cushions. Not only are they of different sizes, but 3 sets are silicone and the other 3 sets are foam. I have had excellent success with the foam earbuds staying put even during super sweaty runs. The silicone ones do a slightly better job of cancelling out outside noises in my opinion, but they were more slippery and tended to move around a bit with sweat. I use them when I???m not at the gym and they work just fine. The over-ear attachment does a great job staying in place and once it hooks over, I completely forget that it???s there. It also comes with a really convenient zipper carrying case that is reinforced with some sort of sturdy foamboard so that I can shove it in the bottom of my book bag and not worry about it being squished. It???s survived laying beneath about 35 lbs of books and laptop without issue. Further, the charging USB cable charges the headphones quickly and has a light notification from red (actively charging) to blue (fully charged).3) VERY convenient Bluetooth pairing that automatically picks up previously paired devices. Works perfectly with my old iPhone 6+ and the iPhone X. The British (Australian??) accent that informs me of a successful pair is now how I start most of my workouts.4) I was talking about these bad boys enoug that I convinced my fianc?? to get a pair as well. After a few weeks, the power button got stuck and we weren???t able to release it. I emailed customer service and within 30 minutes a representative (Jo) had emailed me back apologizing and asked for my order/registration info. Once I sent it to her, she immediately sent me a brand new pair with next-day shipping, no questions asked. No issues with my original pair or the new pair, which have both been used for a few weeks now. She also emailed me back to confirm that they were delivered and functioning properly. For a $30 pair of headphones, I was very impressed by this. I???ve had harder times haggling with returns/replacements for much more expensive ???luxury??? electronics. I think this shows that SoundWhiz really stands by their product.5) Really easy registration process. You can actually do it straight through FB messenger with an automated messaging prompt. Pretty convenient.Full disclosure part 1: the company does offer a small Starbucks gift card for satisfied customers leaving reviews. However, I???m not much of a coffee drinker and did not take them up on this offer. This is a completely unbiased, honest review.Full disclosure part 2: I use Amazon prime extensively. As in I order something at least once a week, sometimes more often than that. That being said, I always check the reviews before I make any purchases and really rely on them. Guiltily, I have never reviewed any product that I have purchased from Amazon (I know, I know!). However, I was so impressed by SoundWhiz that I really felt compelled to write this. Really. This is my very first Amazon review, and I am happy it???s for this product and this company. Good job, SoundWhiz!"
2	:	"These worked great as gym/treadmill headphones for about two weeks -- sound was clear, Bluetooth connection was resilient, and the form factor felt great and kept out all other sound.  But then one of the headphones popped apart.  The poor construction is unfortunate because otherwise these made for an outstanding pair.UPDATE: After posting this review, I was contacted by a SoundWhiz customer representative who promptly sent a new pair. It worked for about 4 months before one of the ears went out completely.Just not solid quality."
5	:	"I purchased a pair of these SoundWhiz earbuds in September 2016. I have been very impressed with the sound quality and all of the accessories that are included. I listen to them all day at work and in my car on the commute home. When I receive a phone call I can easily switch over to talk hands-free, then go back to my music. I can keep both hands on the wheel and enjoy great sound that drowns out the road noise. Recently, I had an issue with one of the earbuds. I contacted customer service and within three days I had another pair of earbuds at my door. They truly honor their 12-month express replacement warranty. This is THE BEST customer service that I have experienced in a long, long time. I have already recommended them to many friends and co-workers. Keep up the fantastic customer service!!UPDATE: Just bought another pair with the Lightning Deal. Now I have earbuds for my car to go along with the earbuds in my office."
3	:	"There are a few things that would make this product better. A little stiffer ear hook and a longer cord with some sort of clip to hold it in place. The sound quality is good and once you get used to the operation of the button to answer the phone, turn the volume and other features these are great. The issue with the cord, clip and ear hook is that many times I use only one, because they truly do drown out the outside sounds, the heaviness of the other side pulls the cord from behind and then pulls the one I have in my ear out due to the really flexible ear hook. I love that they are able to connect to two devices at the same time. Again, the sound quality on both of our pairs are great."
1	:	"These kinda stink. Went on a run with them in/on today and they wouldn't remain looped over my ears. A little jostle meant shoving the buds into my ears to a painful level in order to not carry them the remainder of the run. After stopping four times to put them back in, I gave up. They gave me a headache and didn't stay on. Overall, 0 stars."
5	:	"These are great headphones backed up by a great company providing great service. My wife and I have owned these since early August 2016. My first set failed and were replaced the next day. I broke a set and even though they were not covered because I was at fault, they sent me a 20%off coupon to get another pair. The sound is great and the soft cushions stay in like military grade ear plugs. I sweat a lot and even use these in the dry sauna with no issues. I have only praises for these as I have no connection problems and the warranty is worth the price alone. I highly and strongly recommend these without any reservation. One more thing. If you choose these headphones, make sure you register them to activate the free extended warranty. If you ever need it, they honor it with no questions asked and quickly get you a new pair. Also, you get on a mailing list that, every once in a while, sends you great offers. Some up to 50% off a new pair. I have not used the 50% off coupon before however; the next time I get one, I will order two spares in case I break the ones I have. For the price, this is a ???you cannot got wrong??? value. I was not paid or compensated in any way for this review and feel obligated to apologize for not reviewing this product sooner."
2	:	"I have purchased 2 pairs of these at different times, one in later summer and another this holiday for my wife. My first pair case snapped open on the side that controls on/off functions, but some pressure and glue held it back together and things worked fine. On December 30, 2017 tHe buds went dead. Started a week before with having to redo the Bluetooth connections a couple times when using them and now no connection, no charge, no nothing. Pretty good quality of sound, low bass songs were distorted, but general pop, country, and rock were fine. The multiple bud sizes were helpful, but the left ear piece usually came loose after the sweat started from running. I hope the new purchase last longer."
3	:	"Perhaps my headphones were defective as I believe they were but the sound was clearly unacceptable to me being objective. The bass was actually excellent. Very punchy, better than average. The problem was the rest. It was as if the middle didn't exist at all. I had to use a graphic EQ program and jack it up to get the midrange from these headphones. That got the sound only to the point of tolerance. To explain what I mean, imagine your low bass sounding good and punchy but the vocals and lead instruments sound as if they are a mile away, distant and difficult to hear.The case is super flimsy but not unexpected for what one would expect at this price level. Build quality seemed reasonably good too. But if the sound was truly horrendous in my opinion, which is the primary purpose for buying these.I can't talk about long term such as battery life, etc. because the sound problem was so pronounced from the start. Perhaps I was unlucky. But reading other opinions, perhaps not. And it seems that many of these cheap, obviously imported headphones suffer from the same issues, perhaps from the same manufacturers."
1	:	Wanted something I could listen to music and answer calls with. I like the case and they are comfortable enough. Sound quality isn???t the best but I can deal with it for the price but the worst thing by far is when you are in the phone the person on the other end cannot year me. I have to yell I mean really yell. The noise canceling sucks and you basically have to take one headphone off and talk into it. Will be returning.
4	:	"***this is a 1st week review, check back later for a 1 month, 3month and 6 month review""I have gone through 4 pairs of expensive +$200 wireless ""sports"" earphones before buying SoundWhiz. None of the previous pais last more than 6 months of heavy sweating or running in the rain. At box opening, the earphones were well packaged with concise instructions-my wife paired it with iphone within minutes. It take some time to teach my hands how to hook them onto the ears and to experiment what is the best fitting hooked position. But once the initial ""fitting trail period"" is done, the earphones perform well in a 16km run with gusty winds. The noise cancellation is superb. If running with a companion that may be a problem as you need to resort to sign language or unplug one ear. Sound quality was as described: great boom for base, rich mid range and clear treble. The number of buttons are minimal - so you will need to spend 5 minutes to learn how to activate Siri by using botton combo moves. Overall, very satisfy with the earphones at a $30 value. It is on-par with the +$200 earphones in retail stores."
5	:	"The best ear bud headphones I've ever had!!! I have tiny ears so finding ear buds small enough that don't hurt has been hard. But my search is finally over. The sound is amazing. The range with the Bluetooth is actually pretty far. I can be listening to music on my phone and leave my phone in my kitchen and go upstairs into my bedroom closet and no loose the connection. The charge also lasts for a few hours at least, I've never run the battery out and I've listened to music above 3 hours in a row. They charge fast. I always recharge as soon as I'm done and unplug as soon as they are finished charging. I can go a week in between uses and they will still have a full charge. Hands down the best Bluetooth headphones I have used and I have been through quite a few. And for me to give a review and such a thorough review at that means these are a really good set of headphones. And you can't beat the price!!!!"
4	:	"Got these during Prime Day. Really pleasantly surprised - first bluetooth pair of earbuds I've tried with an ear wrap-around, and it's really unintrusive but helpful.First thing I noticed was the light weight. It almost makes the headphones feel cheap. I was a bit worried until I got them connected to my PC for testing. I felt like I wasn't wearing the headphones correctly because what ""felt"" right seemed wrong. Turns out that when I just went with my gut feeling (earband all the way back against the top front of my ear, buds not ""inserted"" into the ear canal but just resting near the entrance - the logo points a bit above parallel to the ground, so it seemed wrong) these earbuds are awesome.The sound is reasonably isolated without having to cram the buds into my ears which I've had to do with other similar styled devices to isolate outside noise and ensure the headphones don't get jostled loose during activity. I've tested jogging, jumproping, and burpees and have not had any issue with the headphones coming loose - I also have not had to readjust them during activity like I have had to with other devices without an over-the-ear component.I am really impressed with the lightweight of the headphones and the comfort. They look a bit awkward and fit a bit oddly compared to the aesthetics of the device, but what a great value for the money. Here's hoping they are sturdy - this is after using them for one day."
1	:	"Terrible sound quality.  I can't say much about anything else other than they come with a nice little pouch and have a decent amount of ear buds including rubber and foam ones.  I only listened to them for a minute and put them back in the package and placed a return order.  The sound is very very bad. I couldn't even say these have average sound quality, it's just extremely poor."
5	:	"In the past 12 months, I have purchased 5 sets of earbuds; 3 wireless and 2 wired. The SoundWhiz earbuds are the best of the wireless and they sound as good as my Bose Sound Sport In-Ear (wired) headphones. I am a runner and so I wear my earbuds 4 or 5 times a week under less than ideal conditions. Having a pair of ear buds that will stay in place while I am sweating and bouncing around is very important and the SoundWhiz earbuds totally satisfy my need in that regard, considering I always wear safety glasses and a hat when running. They also do a great job of blocking out external noises once fitted to your ears with one of the many pair of provided memory foam tips. Pairing with both my iPhone and my iPod Touch was quite easy and the battery capacity seemed acceptable on some of my 2+ hour runs.  I always charge them before each run so I can???t comment on their 9 hour capacity claim. One issue that did arise was some frequent cut-outs or loss of signal when used in my races.  I found out that this is quite common when there are hundreds of Bluetooth devices in the immediate area. I went back and ran the same courses on practice runs and had no problems with cut-outs.  This is why I wear wired earbuds during a race and wireless at all other times. The feedback and customer service from SoundWhiz is exceptional and much appreciated. Lastly, the sound quality is the best of any wireless earbuds I have tried out.  I like my music loud and with good frequency response across all ranges and this is where the SoundWhiz earbuds shine.  If you like your Bass you will love these earbuds."
5	:	"I usually don't write thorough reviews about products because I've never really received a product that was THIS amazing. These headphones are very loud (which is amazing if you love blasting your music like me). I never really thought about sound-blocking from surrounding sounds around me, but oh my I'm pretty sure I would have a heart attack if someone even touched my shoulder while I had these on. They fit on the ear very comfortably, hang down the neck to about the middle line of your cleavage (if you're 5'3"" like me haha) and for the price as good as what I bought it for, I'd recommend this to anyone.. better yet, that's what I'll do. If you're hesitating to buy this product, know that it's the best product I've bought so far on Amazon, and that's saying so much because I'm a frequent buyer."
4	:	"I bought the Soundwhiz Turbo headset in another attempt to find the perfect workout headphones. These aren't perfect, but they're alright for the price.+They are *very* comfortable, to the point that you barely notice they're on your ears.+The battery will last for maybe six hours of continuous play or so before it requires recharging.+They will stay in your ears. No problems with them falling out.+The buttons on the headset are easy to use and quite handy. It's nice to be able to pause your music or skip tracks/adjust volume without having to pull out your phone.+/- The sound quality is adequate. Bass is a little weak. I wasn't too impressed but it's perfectly fine most of the time.-They will occasionally shift out of alignment with your ear canal and require some readjustment when running or lifting.-The cord that connects the two buds is a little annoying and can snag on your clothing. They come with a small rubber cord clip that I lost pretty quickly because it fell off.Overall, it's an adequate headset for exercising and I have no major problems with it; however I think I'll try another product when these give up the ghost."
1	:	"Waste of money.CONS: Everything. Doesn't fit in women's ears (don't let the product image fool you). Sound quality isn't that great. Price not worth it. AVOID, especially if you're a woman. Another note - I emailed to inquire about a refund so that I wouldn't have to leave a 1 star review. They kept wasting my time with recommendations such as, ""oh, why don't you where glasses with it? It will stay on that way!"" If I wanted to wear sunglasses or even keep the *** **** headphones, I would have. So not only do they have a poor product, but they waste your time on the ""customer service"" end. Avoid at all costs, unless you want someone to siphon away not only your time, but your money."
2	:	"I was happier with my first set, than I am of the second set I just bought. My first set lasted me for a little over a year. I noticed the part where the wires and the ear piece connect became loose so that I could only hear out of one ear piece.I have to say, I am disappointed with the second set.In comparison to my first set, here are the differences:??Old Soundwhiz Set:-?????????????????? The part that wraps over your ear is softer-?????????????????? When you turn off/on the unit, the voice said either ???power on-connected??? or ???power off-disconnected???. You had time to click the button and receive the call before the call travels to voice mail.-?????????????????? The entire unit was very softer and therefore flexible. It was easier to fit in the case-?????????????????? When using the + or ??? button to move forward or backward, or to increase/decrease the volume, it would beep. You can count the beeps and know exactly how many songs you want to move forward, or back.??New Soundwhiz Set:-?????????????????? Rubber is not soft but stiff-?????????????????? Fitting the piece in your ear comfortably, the part that wraps behind your ear doesn???t sit right, and it doesn???t look right either.-?????????????????? The unit now says ???power off-your headset is disconnected?????????power on???.your headset is disconnected???. When you want to answer the call, and turn the unit on, you have to wait until it finishes saying ???power on???.your headset is connected??? before you can answer the call. It may seem small, but that extra couple of seconds it takes to connect, and then wait to hear the long sentence, the call goes to voice mail. Why can???t it just say ???connected: beep???/???disconnected: beep???. My headset is now connected?-well what else would be connected? Duh.-?????????????????? Does not make a beep when using + or ??? to skip or move back songs. It doesn???t beep when turning up/low the volume either.-?????????????????? As soon as I opened the box to look inside, the rubber protector peeled off, and with it, it tore a piece of the casing (cover)off.??????Soundwhiz was my first wireless headset, so I don???t know if the fact they lasted a year and two months is extraordinary.?? I???m not sure if paying $29.00 for a set that lasts a little over a year is a good buy. What do you think?I also purchased the protection coverage with this new set thinking it would be just like my old one. But I think I will return it, and buy other brand. Do you know of any you can recommend? That would be great."
5	:	"I've been using these for a couple weeks now and couldn't be more delighted with the headphones. These replaced a pair of PowerBeats that fell apart at the controller pod after about 30 months. The SoundWhiz headphones fit better and more comfortably into my ears, are lighter weight, and actually sound better than the PowerBeats, which I was pretty happy with. Hope the new cans last as long!"
5	:	"These headphones far exceeded my expectations! These are my first Bluetooth pair.  I go through a lot of headphones since I listen to podcasts and music all day long while I work on my farm. I've gone from cheap $15 pairs to $90 pairs and the sound from these is the best I've experienced. The bass is surprisingly good. Even better than a really expensive pair of Klipsch that I had. One of the issues I've had with the other headphones is the cord giving out or the mic not working because of wear and tear and sweat. I don't see that being a problem with these. I liked them so much I bought 3 pair, one for me, my wife and a back up. 2 of them I got a promo code off Facebook the other I got a code directly from the manufacturer so that's worth a try. The first pair I got were only $14 after the code!"
5	:	"Perfect way to block out the bickering during the roadtrip with my three daughters. All I can hear is the audiobook, podcast or music! Wooosah!!!!???Thank you #Soundwhiz..For cancelling the noise of my kids during our 12 hr roadtrip!  #ATX2ATL #ThankYouNote???"
1	:	I bought these and received them on November 25th. Today is December 6th. 11 days later and they won't turn on at all. Been charging them so I know it's not that. Terrible product. Do not buy. Their return policy requires a lot of things. I also have to pay to have it shipped back to them and pay for it to be insured. I can take that money and buy from some other company. Didn't even last two weeks before they stopped working. Will never buy from this company again.
4	:	I love having a pair of solid bluetooth earbuds for exercising.  I had a different brand that finally wore out and two faulty replacements later was getting fed up. Based upon reviews on amazon and the pricing I gave these a try.  I am pleased that I did and am now feeling better about my workouts.  The tips on these are very comfortable in the ear.  On a tread mill these sit solidly in my ear and do not slip out.  The range of volume is more than I need.  The sound quality is good.  Music is not as sharp as I would like but acceptable and great for podcasts.  I have had other earbuds that are too sharp and cause fatigue so this is probably a good balance for comfort.  Bluetooth range is good and as soon as powered up this immediately connects up with my iphone.  Powering up requires you keep the button pushed for a couple seconds which might lead to confusion until you get used to it.  Actually it is a good feature.  Holds a charge well when not powered.  I have never run out of juice while using but I always charge after several uses.
4	:	"it is a great deal for the price I guess... They fit well with the correct tips, last as long as advertised, and connect well... but the sound is truly awful for anything but voice. They are VERY boomy and muddy with every kind of music and the rest of the sound is lost and indistinct. Wear these on a plane or subway and the boominess is actually uncomfortable. In the gym or running, you cant even hear a kick drum cleanly to keep a beat to your stride... just this intense booming at anything but the lowest volume... and to me, that's the strange part... if you lower them to almost off, the sound is more balanced, but at any decent volume, they are lost. I've tried on multiple devices, and these are the first headphones that you cannot even EQ the ""boom"" out of the sound. I guess you get what you pay for, and these can do in a pinch, but are very disappointing in the sound reproduction.***Updated 9-8-2017***I contacted the customer service dept, and they determined that I have a defective unit. They overnighted me a replacement, and this replacement set sounds much better and fully acceptable... while they are not on par with more expensive audiophile sets, they are great at this price point. The customer service contact and response was 1st rate!"
2	:	"OK product. I've been looking for a comfortable set of Bluetooth earbuds for a while, and while these certainly do the trick, I have since found their quality to be lacking.The pros: These are soft in the ear, have excellent sound performance, and the controls were ingrained faster than I thought would happen. Also work excellent in the gym as the soft ear hooks don't chafe and sweat stays out of the buds. Nice design.The cons: For the first year that I owned these, I have had to replace them twice. I was on my third pair when the same exact thing happened...they simply stopped charging. For the first two broken pairs, the company replaced them immediately with no fuss at all. I was actually pleasantly surprised. The third broke a couple of weeks ago but, now that I am two months past warranty, the company will only give me 20% off of a new pair. Mind you I am a verified purchaser of four pairs of these (three were gifts), and three of their blue tooth portable transmitters (two gifts). The I understand that the warranty period must end, but the quality of these seems to be such that 20% off simply means that I will be spending slightly less money for crappy headphones that are likely to break again.For my money I am done with these. The adage that you get what you pay for seems to aptly apply in this case. It's a shame as I liked the operation and sound, but why throw good money after bad?"
5	:	"edit: 9/27/18Updating my review/score to account for this. I really wish amazon had a PRODUCT score and a SELLER score, because even though the product originally failed the seller was great about the whole thing. The seller deserves 5 stars for taking responsibility for the product and making the buyer happy.So I posted my review and was contacted by the seller soon after. They replaced the earbuds and the new ones work just as well as the previous pair did (which is very well).Old review - Bought these for the wife so she could listen to music at work all day. They were lasting for 8-10 hours for the first month of usage. Now 5 months later she is lucky if they last 4. They occasionally fail to charge as well. We have tried several different chargers and some mornings she will find that they just didn't charge at all.It's a shame because she finds them very comfortable, and she usually has VERY sensitive ears for earbuds."
5	:	"Simply put, these Bluetooth headphones are awesome! The price is low, the sound is excellent, they stay very secure in my ears when I'm running, and they come with multiple earbuds so you can get the perfect fit! The battery lasts for a long time and kind of important to me, the wire connecting them is nice and flat so I can hook it onto the front of my shirt and there's no bouncing of the wire when I'm running. Finally, the customer service is absolutely fantastic! If you're looking for an awesome pair of Bluetooth headphones, look no further, these are the ones for you!***** Update 1/31/18**** SoundWhiz customer service is simply the best!!  I accidentally plugged in the wrong USB cord to charge my headphones and it loosened the charging port when I had to force it out.  I contacted SoundWhiz to ask about getting it fixed and they immediately sent me a new pair for free, no questions asked.  Also, I have tired several other headphones over the last year and a half and these are by far the best, especially when it comes to volume, they are much louder than any other headphones I have tried and the sound continues to be perfect!!"
4	:	"Updating  after owning for a few weeks.. i love these! The company sent me the directions and they were so helpful. They are easy to use and i can walk 15+ feet away without any loss of sound quality.  I liked that this was compact and well put together.  Also comes with various sized ear pieces.  Case nice.  Updating after 10 day use...love it!  Comfortable and easy to use. The company emailed me the instructions.  Sound seems clear and holds decent charge.  For the price, this is a good item"
4	:	"I bought these so just to have some headphones stay in my ear during sweaty workouts and running. So far they have done a decent job staying in on the treadmill and during heavy workouts. Every once and a while some sweat will get in my hear and muffle the sound, but overall they do their job.Sound quality is okay, it gets grainy at full volume and cant handle too much bass, but for the price its decent quality. Battery life for me has been around the 4-5 hour mark until it starts dropping out a little. I can tell when the phones are getting low when I put my phone in my pocket and the music starts to skip.I was not paid for my review, bought these at full price and this is my honest opinion"
5	:	"I search for decently priced, yet good wireless headphones for a long time, and FINALLY found the perfect product!These headphones are comfortable, stay in place, truly are waterproof, and sound great!I would definitely recommend purchasing these headphones!UPDATE 10/9/17So I kept reading that this company's customers service is great, and it totally is!!Contacted customer service regarding an issue i was having and they replied immediately, helped me troubleshoot further, and when the problem was't resolved, they shipped a replacement item.  Now i thought that it would get here with a week, it got to me in 3 days, on a Sunday no less!I can't figure out what's better - the product or the customer service!!Special thanks to Jo Smith and SoundWhiz for the awesome help!!"
1	:	"Most impressive part is that for the money - they work great as Bluetooth headset. I have paired them with my phone as well as my computer (for Skype calls) and anyone I speak with has no trouble hearing me. 1 star off because the actual ear loops while soft (good thing) they have to be looped back around the ear manually every time (like John-boy's glasses for you old enough to remember the Waltons)EDIT!! Worked just great... until one day when they just DON'T work again. I can't get them to power on. The battery is charged (plug in to charger and LED glows red, quickly changes to blue), it's not that the button isn't working (when plugged in, pressing and holding the button causes a beep in the ear piece and the LED to blink red/blue briefly before going to blue). Changed my review to 1 star because I can't give 0 stars. These things lasted 4 months and I'm not hard on them  - no sweating profusely getting them all wet."
2	:	"Sound quality is good and the headphones work perfectly well indoors. The problem is that, when outdoors, the sound cuts out constantly -- meaning that they're functionally useless for their alleged purpose, which is running. A little research indicates that this is a problem with *all* Bluetooth headphones, because of how the technology works. Without walls and furniture to bounce off of, the signal is left trying to traverse the space between your phone in your hand or pocket, and your headphones, on your ears. The problem? The water in your body interferes with the signal.Until such a time as Bluetooth is improved or replaced with a different technology, avoid headphones like these for outdoor activity."
4	:	"I would have given 5 stars had they not crapped out on me. Bought them 7/1/2017 (3 pairs, for me, hubby and daughter) and they have fabulous sound and we love they are water/sweat proof. I have been using mine almost everyday while working out, I keep them in the original hard zippered case they came in, so they are not thrown around and mistreated. I put them on this morning and my music is cutting in and out like a wire is broken, they are repeating themselves when turning on and off, it will say power on, 2 times and power off, 2 times. I have contacted the company about a warranty and hopefully I will hear from them soon because I really do love these but if they are going to crap out after not even 6 months, then I might as well just buy cheaper ones that will last about the same time. My husband uses them for when he mows the property and he loves them, says it was the best birthday present he received this year and my daughter likes hers as well, so I am really hoping they will make this right and send me a new pair and I can give an update on how fantastic their customer service is as well."
4	:	"The first couple of times I was super pleased with these headphones. They were comfortable and they are easy to pair with my iPhone 6s. They are a little too bassy then I would typically like but it's all dependent on what I'm listening to and where I've set  my EQ on my phone. I like bass so this isn't a deal breaker. At this point I've had them for two weeks and the last two times I've used them the Bluetooth signal kept going in and out. At one point, the voice over changed genders and then wouldn't even turn on or off. SoundWhiz is actually really good about emailing their customers on updates and I just got an email yesterday saying that the new updates may interfere with Bluetooth signal and settings. I'm hoping this was the case on Saturday because I spent half of my run with no music and was cursing my headphones ready to return them. Because of the constant communication from SoundWhiz but the inconvenience of signal loss I'm giving this a 4-star rating."
4	:	"They do the job. As long as you use the right size earpiece (they send you a variety of sizes) they stay in your ear pretty well and don't seem to fall out, or hurt to wear for an extended period of time. I use mine for exercise and work calls and didn't want to be stuck to a cord at the gym or my computer so this works just fine. The sound quality I would actually give a 3/5 though because it is not crystal clear on telephone calls like it is with music, but, for the price it does the job."
5	:	"Really pleasantly surprised. My average run is 10 miles, so I'm a sweaty mess by the end, including my ear canals, which are apparently mutant, because I have an awful time getting workout phones that fit well. My last headphones, which I won't bother naming, stayed in my ears, but with some struggling, and they sounded just awful. I've done about 10 of those 10 milers now with these. They in impressively well, and sound AMAZING for the price. I'm still sort of stunned by how good the bass is. First pair of Bluetooth headphones I've found that I can actually run with.Downside? The over-ear things are pretty floppy, to the point I wonder how much they help. Otherwise, awesome product."
5	:	Simply my favorite pair of earbuds. Great bass and overall sound. I've bought 4 or so pairs since I bought the iPhone 7 these are the best.  If you want more bass go smaller on the provided ear tips and push into your ear for a seal. Got another pair recently for cyber Monday that had a slight issue getting the cable in to charge - company immediately sent a free replacement.
2	:	"Before getting a new pair of BT earphones, I researched several options on Amazon and decided on these. I was excited to see how much BT technology had evolved in regards to pairing and sound quality in the past few years; and based on the reviews this seemed like an excellent choice. Perhaps I was unlucky enough to receive a defective pair of lemons, but the sound quality I experienced was terrible. I tried all of the earpod sizes and still they sounded muffled and flat. I have some Soundpeats from 2 years ago that sound infinitely better. I am returning these and looking back to Soundpeats. I did want to mention that they were very comfortable and if the sound were even remotely acceptable I would have considered keeping them."
3	:	"I luv the color, however, the ear plugs that came with these earphones wouldn't stay in my ear and when I tried using them for a call I was told that I sounded muffled and I felt the same about the sound of the person I was trying to speak to him the other end and the caller couldn't hear me talking at all when I had music on in the background.Because they're my favorite color, I was seriously thinking about keeping them, but that wouldn't be sensible or logical. So I'm going to have to return them ????I was really hoping they would've worked out.Another good thing that I can say about them is that the volume is pretty high as well."
5	:	"I got these headphones to use with my iPod.  I am not a fan of earbuds, so I wasn't sure how much I'd like these.  They come with three different size silicone buds and three different size foam buds, and once I found the comfortable one for me, I was hooked.  The piece that goes over the ear is flexible enough to bend around smaller ears.  The sound quality is good, and I had no problems pairing the headphones to my iPod on the first try.  The power and volume buttons are easily manipulated on the earpiece.  The headphones come with a nice zippered case so that they can be stored safely.  All in all, I am very pleased with these."
5	:	"I recently had an opportunity to communicate with Jo in the customer service department of SoundWhiz. I had a small issue with my headphones and initially contacted her for advice. She recognized the problem and rushed replacement headphones to me which arrived on Sunday. Throughout the process she was exceptional! She provided fantastic support and a clear explanation of what/when I should expect the new headphones. Her emails were nice, prompt (within hours of when I sent my email), and clear. She immediately apologized for the issue and accepted responsibility for the defective headphones. Within four or five days of initially discovering the issue with the first pair of headphones I had received the replacement. Hands down, Jo's actions have made me a loyal customer. I intend to purchase SoundWhiz products as gifts and will continue to purchase their products long into the future. Thank you SoundWhiz for being a fantastic company with wonderful products and thank you Jo for being a great person and providing amazing customer service!"
4	:	"Update. A representative contacted me about my issue and offered to send a replacement.  Which i gladly accepted. It has been several months and i am pleased to say its working fine now.  I changed my rating to 4 stars.  Solid but not ideal product.I am not one to write reviews unless I am blown away by a product or disgusted.  I just don't have the time with a business, family and all the activities i have in my life.  So take that into consideration.  this review is not just for this product its for the countless bluetooth headsets i have bought in the past and including this one that are just crap,this one is because it quit working after only 5 months.  It will not charge after it abruptly and with out the usual warnings about a low battery, just shut off.  It told me in one of its pre-recorded messages- your headset is disconnected. I had just finished a ride on my mountain bike after having charged it the day before. the ride was an hour an half.  and i was listening to my pandora on way home in car when it quit.Good luck finding one that works well and you like the sound and the way it wears.  Then just pray it lasts more than a few months.PS.  I have had to deal with other issues with other brands like LG, motorola  and others."
2	:	"The sound is decent. It's what your pay for. If you sit in a desk and stare at a computer, you can work with these.However. If you are an athlete looking for some good wireless headphones, do not buy these. Running outdoors with these was awful.1) When I turned my head to look down the street the sound would cut out.2) As I ran I could hear the power button tapping up and down underneath my music. (The power button is the sound wave logo on the right headphone)I'm sending these back and paying a little more for a better pair."
5	:	"The sound is really good for the price of the product and I finally could find wireless headphones that first fit my ears and second don't fall while I work out. I hated that with all the others I tried before they would start to fall off in the middle of my exercises, like bench pressing, burpees, running, or stuff like that that you either move to much or are lying face up or face down. They are really comfortable and good sound. Not the best, but pretty good for the price. Than you sound whiz for finally having wireless headphones that fit.Battery life is normal, not impressive, but not the worst."
5	:	"These headphones are perfect for athletic and outside activities.  I had tried other such headphones but they have control boxes which made one side heavier which did not feel comfortable.  The ear pieces stay in place and are perfectly balanced.  Pairing is extremely easy with Apple products.  You can wear these for hours with no discomfort.  The carrying case is perfect to carry the headphones to keep them from getting lost, and also contains all charging items.  Elegant and functional design.  The manufacturer recently sent an email notice regarding some pairing issues (which I did not experience).  This shows a commitment to the customer, long after the purchase.  Great product and company--highly recommended."
4	:	"Product failed after 3-months of intermittent use. Turned it off one day & the next day it was ""gone"". Won't power up and won't charge.Waiting on a response from Wiz Technology regarding the 12-month warranty and will adjust this review accordingly.Revised Review:SoundWhiz product support was ""stellar"" in their handling of a warranty replacement sent priority.  Revising to a 4-star but I just have to ding it one star for the product failure itself.Refreshing to have see someone still ""get's it"" with regard to customer support."
5	:	"They work for my needs.  I'm far from an audiophile - I just needed a pair of headphones that would play my music and the run cues from my C25K app while I'm running.  These paired in less than 15 seconds and they stayed perfectly in place for my whole run.  I have tiny, oddly shaped ear canals, and the small ear buds fit me fine.  Also, I was able to put my phone in my shorts pocket and still have perfect reception on these ear buds, something that my old ear buds couldn't do.  I had to keep my phone in my sports bra to get reception with my old set, so these SoundWhiz earbuds are a big improvement."
4	:	"Got these on a lightning deal. So far they work real well. Paired right away with my phone. Standard range for bluetooth headesets. Plenty of tips included so it was easy to find a size that fit in my ear. Does a good job blocking out noise and the sound itself is above average. Gotten at least an hour of straight runtime. Haven't pushed it further than that. Only reasons I haven't given it five stars is the ear clips. I thought they would be stiff like some of my older pairs, but they're a little floppy. Haven't come off my head, but doesn't feel as secure as I would like. Not a deal breaker though. Still a very good pair of wireless headphones for the price."
5	:	"So far I have done a half dozen runs, 2 in the rain, 1 in a 1 hour downpour, and these earbuds have performed very well.  I switched from the regular earpieces to the sound cancelling foam and they do a very good job of filtering out the noise.  My next test for them is on a long flight next week.  We will see if they help me sleep.They re comfortable in my ears, and haven't moved in any run so far.  The initial startup and pairing was great.  I have also had a couple of contacts from the company just to make sure my set arrived in time and everything was good.Its only been a few weeks, but so far so good.  These do outperform my UA buds that finally failed on me."
5	:	I love these headphones. I'm ordering another pair because I dropped them off a sisor lift 25 feet in the air. I also have a pair of Beats and these are 10 times better. I only use beats when I forget these. Highly recommended
1	:	"This is my second pair of these in a few months.  The first product worked OK, though pairing not easy, for a few months before the ear piece female connection point broke, meaning I could no longer recharge.  The replacement pair that arrived today worked on pairing with a tablet, but now will not pair with my phone.  I allow personal idiocy as possible, but having been through the drill three times before, but without success on the fourth try after an hour of trying, I implore all not to buy this product.  Since I live in Panama, sending back to Amazon is out of the question.  I just have to risk more money hoping to get a simple BT earbud that fits, stays on and works as advertised.  This one is not it.  UPDATE.  Tried pairing again today and got it to work on smart phone.  Shouldn't be this hard.  Will now use until this one breaks and then replace with a higher quality brand."
2	:	"I have used these wireless bluetooth headphones for about 6 months now.  The connectivity / pairing is easy and seamless. Sound quality if good but nothing special, it took some time to get use to the ""noise cancellation"" as when I put them on it and turned them on with no music it sounded like I was in a tunnel but this is not a big deal.  The reason for three stars is that after 6 months the ""grip"" on the rubber piece that hangs over the ear has worn down significantly.  If I am doing static exercises, no problem they will stay on my ears, but if an exercise involves any movement such as burpees, situps, running, or if I need to be inverted or flat on a bench they just don't stay in any longer.  I was hoping to use them on my next ski trip but will stick with old school wired option with ear skinz."
5	:	"Love these! Good base, I'd like a tiny bit more,they are bassy, and they definitely have much,more more than any of the others types of these headphones. Paired almost instantly. Doesn't drop the bluetooth, multiple ear plug sizes that are easy to change. I've wasted a lot of money on other models and will not pay $$$$ anymore. Jaybirds totally suck. These are finally something I don't have to waste time trying to get them started. Ran with them in pouring rain several times and have not had any issues. I hope they keep these around. Also, I received emails from the company immediately after purchasing with registration reminder, manuals and phone number to call should there be any problems. They've kept reaching out to see if I like them so I wanted to make sure I paid it forward. Keep up the good work!"
2	:	"This is my second pair of these headphones. The first pair lasted almost 3 years  with heavy use, at work, the gym (even in the dry sauna). So when that pair started to die, I bought another pair July 2018 and they have already stopped charging today December 2018, less than 6 months later. There is clearly a short or something in the charging port, since the red ""charging"" light will come on for a second if the plug is held at a certain angle and then it goes out. I know it is not an issue with the cord, because I tried it in another device and it charges just fine. I really loved these earphones too because the battery life lasted for days at work. And they have a long range for the Bluetooth, I can leave my phone in the locker room at the gym and still play music clearly on them. Very disappointed!"
4	:	"These headphones are good quality for the money. I paired them with a 7th generation ipod. No problems with the pairing process. The sound is great overall. I judge headphones by the bass output. Once you get the ear pieces to fit correctly, the bass is amazing. I am still having problems trying to get the high tones to come through clearly. I checked all of the equalizer settings and found an acceptable setting on Acoustic. They are a touch bulky but they have not fallen out of my ears yet during exercise and they do not move much in general. Overall a good product and I would buy them again."
5	:	These fit great for all ear sizes even small ears like mine and they are very comfortable to wear. It comes with changeable ear pieces which is really nice. They also sound great. Definitely worth it.
2	:	"These are ok headphones. Definitely not 4 or 5 stars. Here's all the reasons why. They are not tight around the ears. They would definitely fall out swimming which is shown in the product picture. The main button is in a bad position so you accidentally press it any time you adjust them. If you are on a phone call, this will end the call. The sound quality is not that good. And the noise cancelling is a false advertisement in my opinion. It is not electronic noise cancelling, it is just done by fitting the different size ear buds to your ear."
5	:	"I love these headphones, but have gone through two pair. This last set had trouble pairing at first and worked for a few months then died. I went out to run one day and they would not power on. The charging no longer lights up when plugged in and cannot get them to power up on respond in any manner.When they work they have great sound and stay on will when running or exercising.Updated 1/25/2018-------------------------------The seller contacted me and offered to replace the defective units free of charge. Even after I missed the email and replied a month or so later, they still accommodated me and sent a new set.I have a feeling that the first set was possibly defective on purchase as I had a little trouble pairing them with my phone whereas this new set paired right up and worked on the first attempt.To expand on my review a little bit:I had tried several other headphones prior to these that claimed to be waterproof or water resistant but failed. I use these when I run a lot. Often in the Ohio summers it's humid and hot. Two other sets I had from other manufacturers failed after a few weeks of sweating on them. The first set of these I had (which were stolen from my vehicle) were great. I ran in them all summer and worked out through the winter. The second set appeared to fail due to a defect but were replaced by the vendor without hassle.I would highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for a decent set of wireless earphones for running."
5	:	"With so many games that merchants play paying strangers or begging friends and relatives to do fake, one-sentence, reviews, I had to really be careful when I wanted to buy a couple of sets of head phones - ear buds and an over-the-ear, noise-cancelling piece.  Initially, I didn't have the owner's manual with me (wife only brought me the product on a trip) and felt a little discombobulated.  So my advice is to make sure you read the manual AND are familiar with how bluetooth works with your device.  Know that to connect to a second device, you need to first unpair it from the first one. At first I found the Multi-function button to be in an odd place, as I'd keep pressing it unintentionally, but once you've read the menu and get use to the lay of the land, it's fine. It comes in a little case with a short charging cord, and several pairs of different styles and sizes of earbud pieces. I found the sound to be excellent when using the foam earpieces - the silicone ones don't give as rich a bass, nor do they keep ambient sound out nearly as nicely.. It's not super comfortable for someone who wears glasses or sunglasses, but it's not that bad.  The battery lasts a long time - I'll test to see if it really is 9 hours.  It fully recharged in 2 hours.  When the battery is low, it gives you several warnings that will interrupt your listening; it'll die about 5 minutes later. A very satisfying buy for just over $30."
4	:	"These are exactly what I was wanting from earbud headphones! Simple to use, minimal struggling with the wire and they come with multiple different earbuds to find one that fits your ear needs! I took off one star because yesterday there was a good bit where it was NOT able to connect to my phone for about an hour of trying. I got it to work but I'm worried this might persist... I hope not though because other than that they're perfect. They're really good at canceling out surrounding noise too! Which is important if I want to wear these while working out or anything."
1	:	"I recently joined the gym and started working out fairly regularly. I'm clumsy enough that I manage to clothesline myself every single time with my headphone cord, so I decided to reward my hard work and effort with a new pair of bluetooth earphones. These were--in short--a steaming pile of crap. I used them a grand total of one time before the audio output completely stopped working. I went through every avenue imaginable to fix this (turn it off/back on, re-pair from scratch, try pairing with another device, try resetting the device, etc. and so on), but I could not get them to work. I boxed them up in order for them to be returned today and get a refund. I will not buy from this company again."
1	:	"I knew when I was investing around $30 on a pair of wireless headphones that I couldn't expect too much. I feel like I did my research and these were the best available option in the price range I was willing to spend. They feel cheap in hand but I couldn't really expect much more. They did come with a few different ear pieces and a nice carrying case.Initially they were okay. I tried them first with my old iPhone 3Gs that I use as an iPod. They sounded terrible with that and I don't know exactly why. The bass was very muted and the range was terrible. I had to have the phone in my pocket or else it would cut out. I then used them with my iPhone 6s and they got better but the sound quality still wasn't great. I used them 3-4 times a week for my hour long workouts. Battery life wasn't great but charging once a week or so wasn't too big a deal. As others have commented, the battery low notice seems to go every 15 seconds before they finally power down after about 5 minutes of warning. I was okay with the performance and was willing to live with the limitations, but after about 4 months they just wouldn't turn on. I powered them down the day before and tried to turn them on the next day to no avail. They wouldn't connect to power or do anything. They are just dead. I sent an email to the manufacturer asking for any tips or assistance and received nothing. As I've said, they weren't that expensive so I didn't expect too much, but flat failing after 4 months of what I would call light use and no response for the manufacturer is frustrating. I would not recommend these to anyone!"
5	:	"I've had inexpensive waterproof headsets before.  They were either uncomfortable due to the drivers in theear connection or they were very tinny.This set was neither or those.  I was able to get them up and connected after charging them completely in about 5 minutes.  The biggest difficulty was finding the hatch to set the charger connection too.  That usually is the mostprecarious because once that little piece of rubber slips then it no longer ends up being 'water proof'.  But it unhingedand I was able to charge,  connect to my phone (Galaxy Note 4) and be on my merry way.The sound was much better than I expected.  For heavy bass songs it is lacking just a little bit but unless you are truly into being an audiophile it isn't barely noticeable.  I didn't submerge the headset (I do water aerobics) so I didn't test the claim of it being water proof/water resistant.I would definitely suggest that someone give these a try if they are looking for something to work out in."
5	:	"These are good lightweight earphones with big sound.  I like that they have those little hooks to hold them on and a variety of ear buds.  I have super-tiny ears and other than the hooks being a little large for my small ears, which requires me to kind of spin them around more toward the back, these things are great!  The little case is also nice to keep them in when not in use.  The overall sound is much better than the Skull Candy ones I bought at WM and returned that cost twice as much as these at nearly $50.00.  Save your money.  If you want reliable rechargeable headphones at a decent price with big sound, get these!"
5	:	"I purchased these headphones for working out, and absolutely love them.  After trying various other bluetooth brands and being frustrated with poor sound quality,  lag time, and/or a terrible fit I was stoked to finally find a pair of running headphones that actually hit all the marks! Which is why I was totally bummed when I experienced an issue with the battery after only a month. Needless to say, I shared my dissatisfaction right here in the review section...and what happened next was nothing short of incredible.The team at SoundWhiz reached out to me directly the same day to make things right.  They were understanding, professional, and eager to resolve my issue.  In fact, I was blown away at how quickly I received my replacement pair - which are sweet I might add!  So many companies claim to put the customer at the center of everything, but rarely back up that sentiment with action.  SoundWhiz is different. I definitely 'felt the love'.  Big thumbs up to Jo & Giles for truly mastering the art of Customer Experience.I highly recommend not only this product, but also supporting this unique company."
4	:	"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive wireless sports headphone for my runs on the treadmill at home. I needed it to be water or at least sweat resistant. Well, these have been great so far. The audio seems great to me, though I???m no audiophile. Produced great mids and highs, though the bass isn???t as loud as I would have wanted, but for its price, was good enough. Came with several sizes of silicone and foam tips, and I had to try out different tips and eventually found a silicone pair that fit well. It comes with the medium silicone tip attached. Great product so far. Comes with USB to mini-USB charging cable, case and instructions. Instructions were easy to follow. Would highly recommend for every day use."
4	:	Great except for one problem - I keep accidentally calling people (double click) when I try to turn them off (one long click).
3	:	I bought these after some thorough research because they were highly rated for a good price. I needed a set of waterproof wireless headphones because I didn't want to wear my Beats on my paddle board. I like the over ear fit (similar to my Beats by Dre) and they have decent sound quality but I wish the volume control was on the cord rather than the ear piece (though that could just be because that is what I am used to). Overall a good product for a decent price especially for water sports. I would likely not wear them running or to work out unless I couldn't find my other set.
3	:	"While these are fine headphones there are certain limitations that should be shared:1. The bluetooth range is less than 3 feet... put your phone in your pocket and the headphones start to disconnect;2. The neck strap seems to get stuck on anything with a collar... this is a nuisance;3. Running/walking into a wind makes listening impossible... wind noise is comon and not fixed by changing out ear plugs.However, for the price the SoundWhiz headphones are pretty darn good but don't look for perfection."
5	:	"I was really looking for earbuds that had good quality sound.  These have that and more.  Although, I did have a little trouble adjusting to the right side for answering calls and volume.  Once I figured it out and made it work for me. I was good to go!"
5	:	"This is my first pair of this type of headphones and I'm wondering what took me so long! They have better noise cancelling properties than I was expecting, even when not turned on. The sound is soooo much better than with my wired earbuds! I love not getting that long wire tangled up in anything when I use them outdoors while gardening. They stay on well and are definitely sweat proof as evidenced by using them for long, sweaty workouts with no problems. I highly recommend these!"
5	:	"I am averse to gadgets as I tend to lose things. But, after getting my traditional headphones tangled on gym equipment and watching my phone fly across the room, I felt it was time to get a Bluetooth pair. I opted for these based on price and positive reviews. They arrived as promised. I charged them first and followed the essy to understand instructions; and they paired with out a glitch. The sound was excellent and they fit nicely. I also appreciate the carrying case for securing and transport."
4	:	"Thank you for including multiple sizes and materials. The ones originally on it hurt my ear. The ear wrap would be nice to be adjustable - it is significantly too big for my ear, so doesn???t stay put well when I???m running. Because of where the buttons are located, I inadvertently change something during the multiple times I must adjust during a run to keep the ear buds in my ears. Also, as a runner, I prefer to be able to hear some of the noise around me. These pretty effectively block out the outside noise - which many desire, but I don???t prefer. That didn???t impact my rating - my rating is due to fit."
1	:	I had to change my review. I have had these earbuds for six weeks and they no longer work properly. Lot's of static. I have to hold my head perfectly still to avoid the static. Very dissapointed. A big waste of time and money.
5	:	"I have owned these for about a month now and wanted to allow some time before posting a review. So far they have surpassed my expectations in terms of comfort, audio, durability, and practicality.I am someone who cannot wear (fitting, headaches) the i-Phone buds and just about any other headphone with a bracket on top.  I can barely tell these are even around my ears when walking or running. They have stay attached to both ears for the entire run and/or walk and have required minimal adjustment.They have additionally taken a ton of sweat coming off my head and ears and continue to play without issues to this point.  I have enjoyed these so much, I just purchased another pair for my friends birthday.I will definitely add to the review at some point after some additional time but I can tell you that I researched about 5 other leading brands that are offered on Amazon within this price range and you will find none better.I hesitated to pull the trigger and was overwhelmed with my search but I can save you the hassle and tell you these are the ones you want."
5	:	This is a great product that I use when running.  It has a solid connection that does not break up and maintains good sound quality
5	:	"Absolutely love these!! Prior to purchasing this product I used an over-the-ear set. They were okay, but the sound was fair and they felt a bit clumsy during my runs. I also find over the ear sets hard to wear on days I wear my glasses. I was hesitant to try these as I have small ears and most of the earpieces either hurt or fall out during activity. But these babies are great. They stay put, are comfy and sound great. Super light weight too. I ordered pink so my husband wouldn't borrow them :)Came in a nice little hard case for storage. Would buy again and am planning to get a few a gifts."
2	:	"At first these worked really well, a week of regular use and the volume buttons became mushy but everything still worked.One month later, connectivity became worse, often interrupted just by my hand moving when my phone is in my right pocket. Another month has passed and nothing changed until one night when I heard ""battery low"", turned them off, put them aside and switched to another pair of earbuds, I later plugged them into my PC yo charge for an hour before leaving and they wouldn't turn on anymore, blue light constantly on when plugged in but no matter how long you press, they don't turn on. Different cable or USB port didn't change that."
5	:	"I have had them a few hours and they are amazing! Wonderful sound, easy to setup and use. Only takes a few seconds. I am buying a second pair for my son! These are even better that my PlayStation Gold headset! They sound better than phone Bluetooth. These are the best way to go for a premium easy to use earbuds. I wish I had known about these six months ago! This business got it right!"
5	:	"My 14 year old daughter thinks I'm cool.  ME!!  All because I was awesome enough to buy these totally amazing bluetooth headphones.  She loves how they give her freedom as she runs, how she can leave her phone in her pocket and still listen to music as she works out, how the sweat doesn't make them slip out (but she's a girl, so no, she doesn't sweat, but in case she did, you know?).  The sound is clear, the fit is very comfortable and basically I may actually get her to do the dishes now without much prompting cause she can listen to music as she washes them.  Oh, who am I kidding, that's not going to happen no matter how waterproof they are."
5	:	Customer service at SoundWhiz was great and replaced my non-working headphones in 3 days. I had been enjoying these headphones when one day they stopped working. No lights when they were charging. I called customer service and Sandra from SoundWhiz took my call and after trying to troubleshoot the issue over the phone without success she apologized and said they would send a replacement in 3 days. There might have been a power surge at home so I???d recommend making sure you charge the headphones on a power strip. In any case these are very good headphone especially for running and a great value for the price. More importantly the sound quality is great.
3	:	"Received these in a timely manner and the case and the ear buds are great.Unfortunately, I cannot use the ear buds because the hooks go about an inch above my ear, this gets rid of any option of wearing them while working out.  If I wore my glasses, I could not wear these at the same time. If you have SMALL EARS DO NOT BUY THESE. I gave them away to someone with larger ears. I would have returned them, but in order to return them, you have to pay 6 dollar shipping. This may contribute to the low return rate because I am not paying 6 dollars to returns something I do not want, I would rather give them to someone who can use them."
4	:	"The multiple ear pieces work great and you can turn the earpieces to fit perfectly. It doesn't do things like Dolby Atmos and similar audio boosts that very expensive headphones have, or really true noise cancelling (though they do fit nice and tight), but you get a great bang for the buck. I can use it with any of my devices to sync and listed to everything on these BT headphones. The turbo ones are great so far. And looks great. Never falls out when running either."
2	:	"The advertising copy is misleading a hence the two stars. The battery is UP TO 8 hours, not 8 hours -the actual box states 6 to 8.  Also they claim that these are noise cancelling headphones and they are not - they are just headphones, the only noise cancelling comes from having something in your ear. The cvc 6 rating on the box for noise cancellation is for cancelling noise during a call for whoever you are talking too -which is NOT what I (and I suspect most people) interpret as ""noise cancelling headphones""."
1	:	"If you are a runner, then do not buy these headphones.  They do not stay in your ears.  I tried every insert and none of them keep them in my ears.  The loops that wrap behind your ears are so flimsy, that they are useless.  I think the weight distribution seems to favor them falling out of your ears during the run."
5	:	"I purchased the SoundWhiz Turbo headphones about 7 months ago and have been using them every time I go running.  Unlike generic earbud , (which often flop out of my ears when running) the SoundWhiz comes with three sizes of comfortable silicone earbuds to fit just about anyone.  This is important when you're working out at a noisy fitness center that blares its music and messaging from its sound system far too loudly.  But here's where SoundWhiz really stood:  The true test of customer service comes not when everything goes well--it's when something goes wrong.  For whatever reason, after seven months, my headphones would no longer take a charge.  I contacted their customer support department and asked for advice.  They had me try a couple of unpairing/resetting steps.  But when that didn't work, they cheerfully shipped a brand new set of headphones to me.  Simply AMAZING customer service!  Even if the same thing happens seven months from now, I'll cheerfully buy a new pair at full price."
5	:	"I bought two pair of these for a 500 mile hike in Spain.  The sound quality is excellent.  The battery life is phenomenal.  We hiked the Camino de Santiago and used these every day for music bluetoothed to our phones.  They headphone have been through rain, cold, packing, pockets, backpacks, airports, and the like.  Six months later, they are as good as the day we bought them.  I've worn them for 6 hours with constant streaming and the battery was still good.  I've yet to wear them to the point the batteries are drained.  Love ''em 200%!"
1	:	Quit working after 3 weeks usage. Won't turn on after being g fully charged
2	:	"My husband bought a pair of these earphones and they worked really well for him so I thought I'd buy a pair for myself. Unfortunately the ones I received are NOT the same as the original version. The part that wraps around the ear is not rigid enough and the earbuds fall out of my ears even when I'm sitting still. I tried all of the included silicone and foam earbuds to try to get them to fit, but no luck. Sending them back for a ridiculous $7.00 return fee. Take my advice and spend another $20-25 to get a decent pair of running headphones. I bought some Plantronics Backbeat Fit earphones and I really like them."
5	:	"These are wonderful purchase! I was looking forward to get my hands on them! They areived ystrd and i put them on charge right away, although the instruction says they can be used right out of the box. I charged them at night and they were ready to use in the morning workout session. They do not slip and hold tight on your ear, even thiugh i jump and move a lot. The sound is clear and they are lightweight. Might seem a bit bulky though. Hope their sweat proof function works well. The customer sevice is amazing. Guys emailed me several times asking if everythinng was ok, and informed me of warranty. I would have missed it if not for them. Their support sevice works in social media too) they help you with warranty in no time) look forward to my experience with them. I might come back with more infor but this is for now)"
5	:	"This is my first foray into the market of wireless bluetooth devies. And I'm pretty sure it'll be my last! SoundWhiz has my complete loyalty. They're great with charge, easy to connect, and perfect for both my music and calls. They're easy to use and great when used. My friends and family hear my voice better through these than just with my iPhone, and it's so easy to go hands free while I'm running errands. I use them to listen to music at my desk and can take calls easily. And I absolutely love the pause/stop/power button on the right ear! I'm absolutely in love and don't see myself using any other product at all.P.S. Their emails from Giles are so sweet and heartwarming. I'm in love with this company. You have my undying support! :)"
5	:	"After returning 3 pairs of Dr. Dre earbuds, none of which worked more than 3 weeks, I decided to look for something that works and is reliable.  The Turbos are perfect for my workouts which include a steep incline treadmill and heavy perspiration.So far so good!  The fit is perfect and they are very comfortable to wear.  I have very large hands so the small on/off button is a little difficult to use.  It's definitely not a major problem."
5	:	"So far so good. I have not gotten rained on wearing these yet so I cannot speak to its being waterproof but the sound is much better than several other BT headphones I have tried. The bass does not distort at high levels. The case that it came with is also top notch. I am a big fan of good cases and this one is large enough to fit the headphones, charging cable, my workout nano and the charging cable for that. Overall, based on how this thing lasts will dictate if I would buy it again."
3	:	"Product is exactly what I was looking for - ear buds that won't fall out even if sweaty and active. Pairing and connecting works flawlessly, how Bluetooth is supposed to but doesn't always work.But the battery is dead in 2 hours. Maybe 3 under ideal conditions.Make one ear piece bigger to accommodate a bigger battery. Nobody is buying these for how they look anyway."
3	:	"The product is okay.  The comfort is great.  The button layout is clumsy.  When pushing into my right ear, I have turned the off repeatedly.  My preferred arm is my left one because I want to use my dominant hand (right) to control my phone.  When it is on my left arm, it occasionally breaks in communication with my Samsung Note 4.  Therefore, I have to wear it on my right arm.  I am thoroughly impressed with the waterproof construction.  I would be willing to try a new generation from this company if they work out the buttons and loss of communication."
1	:	"This product is very uncomfortable for smaller ear lobes, also the ends are very heavy causing them to fall off when working out. Lastly the bottom on the right ear which controls your music is way to sensitive, your music will be playing without your knowledge."
1	:	"The ear hooks on these are near worthless. In an attempt to make them light weight, the hooks themselves do absolutely nothing to help keep the ear buds on your ear. Saying that these are a ""sport"" ear bud is misleading, since they fall off if you try to move your head."
5	:	Bought these Bluetooth earphones because of their weight and reviews. These are the lightest ones after spending an afternoon of researching on Amazon. So far I love them. I walk and run with them . Like them so much I bought another pair as a gift. I hardly know they are on they are so lightweight and are a perfect fit. Very comfortable on. They send 8 different ear buds. They recommend trying on all of them to find the perfect fit. The price was amazing for the quality.
1	:	"Sound is ok.  Fit is ok.  The wire connecting the two earpieces is not great.  It flops, twists, etc when I am running.  Becomes a bit of an annoyance on the back of your neck.  Also, there is no way to tell the battery charge level.  So you have to be conscious as to how many times/how long it was since the last charge.  Overall I would probably give it 2.5 stars.Not too long after writing this, I found that I had it charging, and when I came back the battery had swelled and destroyed the ear buds.  Same charging point on my computer USB... so I wouldn't bother with these."
5	:	"I lost my first Bluetooth earphones and have been using a plug in model which was a pain at the gym.  I finally took the plunge and invested in a new pair.Pairing with my iPhone was very easy. The ear hooks are very comfortable.  It took a few tries to change the ear plugs but I finally figured out the twist and pull method, certainly not an issue.  I have used it at the gym on recumbent bike and at home on my glider and treadmill.  The plugs stayed put.  People complain about the sound quality but I find it very good. I have no issues at this time and expect none."
5	:	"For the short time I've owned these, they have exceeded my expectations in about every category. They stay connected well even out of sight. The battery life is great which was my biggest concern. I typically listen at the lowest possible volume while at work and have gotten 1.5 days worth of time on a single charge!  The fit is good and sound quality is pretty decent... All for $30.... I'd buy again for sure."
5	:	"Includes a protective case, a nice surprise. Only been using the headset a few days and so far it works well, as expected. I'm using it in the open office area for Skype and WebEx conferences. Works well. And noise around me is blocked. The only issue I am still working on is getting the right fit in one ear. I can't figure out how to get the spongy adapters to fit on the earpiece. The silicon ones don't hold a solid connection on the one ear."
4	:	These felt like they would be flimsy when I got them out of the package and I thought I was going to be disappointed in them. I was pleasantly surprised that my assumption was wrong. No complaints from me on the sound and they do not budge when I run or workout. The different size and type ear pieces are nice too. Easy to find the perfect fit. I???ve only had them a month so I will have to see how durable they are as time goes on.
4	:	"I've been looking for wireless headphones for a while now, and settled with this one for its features and price. It fits really well, even when I wear my glasses. The flashing light does get annoying sometime, and it's sometimes confusing when the red light flashes because I'm unsure if it means low battery or if it's not synced to anything. However, it's a great product that holds up to my overactive sweat glands and has definitely made my workouts a lot better."
3	:	"The natural sound is not very crisp and it's very base-heavy, and there doesn't appear to be any equalization settings where the base and treble can be adjusted. I found myself being annoyed almost instantly and it hasn't worn off. It's got the most imbalanced sound of the 2 or 3 different brands I've gone through over the years, all at the same approximate price point. Admittedly they were all wired models so this is my 1st bluetooth wireless. Perhaps the sound quality is just sub-standard on an equivalent bluetooth model? If so I'll go back to wired, it's not worth the dramatic descrease in quality. Other than that they are comfortable and have a variety of ear plugs, but none of that matter if the sound stinks.I'll maybe give it a few more days of commuting, but I have a feeling these are getting returned."
5	:	"Very seldom can I sync these headphones with my devices. It takes multiple tries and then you may get lucky. I had an $8 pair that works much much better. Don't know if it's this unit or all in general.Update: The company contacted us promptly to help me reset them or replace them if defective. The reset would have probably cleared the issue, but in the meanwhile a family member discarded the unit. This company is obviously an upstanding company and I'm sure the issue would have been resolved by them one way or another"
1	:	I have had these headphones for just over a month and while running today (after I fully charged them overnight) they quit working and now will not charge at all. So upset.
1	:	I accidentally ordered them. I think I hit the one touch order button. Disabled it after this. I figured why not give them a shot since they wear on the way. So I tried them not grate sound quality. I have had $5 Walmart headphones that have better sound quality. They lasted an acceptable amount of time before charging. The thing that prompted me to write a review about them was build quality. The second time I charged them the force required to insert the charging cable broke the charging port broke off and rendered them 100% nonfunctional. I have another pair of equally low cost wirless head phones I bought from amazon thay functions exponentially better. If your looking for budget headphones don't purchase these.
5	:	"I really like it (and I am very picky about my headphones for running)!  The sound is very clearand the volume is strong even with the noise of traffic nearby.  It stays securely in my ears (and is comfortable) while I am running, in sharp contrast to some high priced competitors.  It is very liberating at  reasonably price.  Thank you Sounwhiz!"
3	:	"It's now 08/2018, I purchased these in 11/2017. Sound, material everything is/was fantastic! Battery lasts quite long too! Very satisfied customer when the product is functioning. Today for the first time I am experiencing my left head phone going out, all cords in tact perfectly and I am rather sad this had happened as well as disappointed only because they were so great! I don't know if I will pay the $30+ dollars again and/ or if just under 1 year of use makes the money worth it i have truthfully spent more on a dinner. It's a toss up, really. I am Working out anywhere from 2-4 times a week and needless to say interruption to that work out i.e. headphones going out is a buzz kill if you will."
1	:	They aren???t really that sturdy around the ears and the music keeps glitching . I wanted to love this but I should have went with a better brand.
2	:	"This product worked great out of the box and the fit was comfortable.  For the price I was impressed with the sound quality and they appeared to be sweat proof.  However I'm giving these two stars because when the battery went low, the head phones would pause the music on my iphone or disconnect completely without warning.  Battery indicator is ineffective.  Also giving two stars because after about 6 weeks, they stopped holding a charge all together and are now just a pile of plastic on my desk.  These should have a longer return window."
4	:	"Great fitting headphones.  I use them at the gym for a couple of hours and walk in them daily.  They stay connected to my ear, the cord attaching the two is not in the way or uncomfortable.  If a mild wind is blowing while walking you can hear the wind rush by the earpieces when your talking or listening to music.  Some of that noise can be heard by those your connected to while on your phone.  I like them because of the sound, comfort and price.  I have three other pair of ear pieces that I am comparing them to and these are my favorite.  I would purchase this product again."
3	:	"I loved these ear buds, until I could not charge them anymore.  The casing inside has moved and it will no longer take a charge.  I can get the charger to go in, but that's it.  I've had these over 6 months and wore them about 2-3 times per week.  I would buy them again, but I'm not going to with all the options that are available."
2	:	"I've owned these for over a year without any issue up until relatively recently. Good battery life, sounded just fine, etc. About 2 months ago the left earbud started to malfunction with sound randomly cutting out whenever I even slightly move my head. It's extremely annoying and has nothing to do with the device it's connected to. I've tried everything to reset the connection but nothing helps. I'm looking at alternatives but every product like these on Amazon is basically the same device with different branding. Probably gonna look off Amazon for a replacement."
5	:	"Product support and follow up was amazing. Product arrived on time and well packagead. Although the write ups talk about this headset as a ""listening"" device, I use it with my phone for work. The buds are comfortable, stay in place and provide excellent sound quality for both listening and talking. Great product that I will recommend time and again."
5	:	"These bluetooth headphones got my attention with the great reviews that I read. The sound quality is better than I expected. Bluetooth pairing is quick. Easy control functions on earpiece. Very clear and precise instruction booklet. Wonderful to know that Soundwhiz cares about the customer enough to produce a great product at an affordable price and to back it up with a guarantee. I use these while exercising, bicycling, yardwork and listening to audio books while doing house work. Very happy with purchase!"
5	:	I purchased SoundWhiz Turbo Bluetooth headphones as a present for my husband. I love the case that comes with the headphones and the extra set of earphones to get the right ones to fit. Set up was easy and I did enjoy receiving emails from the company to check and see if everything with the set up went well.  I???m thinking of purchasing a pair for myself.
5	:	"Update: my first pair had a shortage and the company reached out to me and sent me a new pair free of charge. First, I loved the customer service. The new set are pretty good, I did still notice a very short break in sound if the cord is pulled near the power switch ear bud. However, the sound is so clear and perfect. It completely blocks out all sound on the train while commuting in the city. The phone calls are very clear, pausing the music and connecting to your phone is extremely easy. These are very user friendly. Also, they are very comfortable to wear as well."
5	:	"WOW!  I was not expecting such great product.  I have looked at several different ear blue tooth ear buds and can tell this product is well designed and thought out.  The fit is super for an active runner and the lead length between the ear buds is just slightly longer, which is perfect.  The db output is amazing and operating the product is the best I've tried.  I have a slight hearing impairment from birth so all of the others I have tried were not capable of delivering the sound quality and output I needed to make calls and listen to music.  I will definitely order another of these products as a spare and look for these guys to make a splash in this market."
4	:	"So far so good. I paired them successfully, as for the ear hooks, for my size ears they are pretty useless. Generic build for average male heads it seems. However, the sound is good and the buds seem to stay nicely in the ears. Shipping was quick enough. Nice little case to keep them in. Sound is good but I am not an audiophile. I use them for walking to and from work. They are pretty new so I can't attest for battery life. If it's good I won't amend my review.Customer support so far is VERY good. They are on top of letting people know any issues that may come up with your smart phone (pro-actively)."
4	:	"It is been a week using them so far they are still working.They are very comfortable and light weight.The sound system is pretty good.They are really waterproof, I already tested them while a ran under the rain.The reason why I rated them 4stars is because you can hear the wind flowing while running which is very annoying because you can barely hear the music.Overall I think they are great for the prize."
5	:	"I wanted to get another Bluetooth set due to me old ones getting ruined by moisture.....these seemed to answer that problem.I haven't have enough time to test their waterproof claims, but the sound quality is much better than I expected. The fit was great for me right out-of-the-box. The ear hooks seem extremely flexible but seem to do the job. Connectivity was fast and easy with my iPone6 and my iPod.I walk at least 5 miles every week day for my commute to work...rain or shine... so these will be used a lot. In a strong breeze or wind I hear the noise, but it's nothing I am concerned about.Overall, I'm really happy with these so far. I opted for the 2 year warranty. Here's hoping that I never have to need it."
3	:	"I've had these for about seven months and they worked really well - good quality of sound and a single charge lasts several hours. However, one of the ear pieces broke and fell out of my ear during use, exposing the wiring within. The casing doesn't seem to be very durable."
5	:	"Update 3/20/18: I wore these in the ocean, they are definitely waterproof. Obviously bluetooth does not work under water but they worked great with my phone in a waterproof case.These connect to my iPhone SE easily. Sound quality is great. Many different styles and sizes of ear cushions to choose from. Range is 20-30 feet. I also use them to connect to my TV."
5	:	"After trying 3 pairs of blue tooth earphones, I've finally found the perfect pair!!! These are awesome!! Fit is good, sound is awesomely clear with mo annoying static or humming. I'm very pleased with this product...I actually now have 2!! I use them literally all the time, so I ordered the 2nd pair so I'll always have one charged and I'm now completely cord free!!! Love these!!"
2	:	"Had high hope for these based on reviews. But after a couple of days the left ear bud had low sound and the right ear bud was staticky every time I would raise the volume. Contacted the seller, they advised me to reset the headphones, but that didn???t make a difference. Unfortunately I had to return them. My quest for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones continues."
5	:	"Amazing headphones if your in the market for affordable Bluetooth headsets that are sweatproof and can be what it says it is please get these I'm a hardcore apple Fan but Powerbeats 3 has a serious hardware problem with sweat getting into the Powerbeats 3 controls currently having to send the beats back a second time just got them in the mail from apple but they did not work they send me a replacement broken headsets and now I Think my warrantys out because they sent it late and the new beats don,t even charge please get the soundwhiz as of now because I believe there very good and you also get a great quality case hardcover and different ear tips included also been getting very friendly and helpful emails from soundwhiz they care what they send you and makes sure you got the product you ordered on time or at all"
3	:	I don't hate these but I wouldn't buy them again. The hook that goes over the ears is way to flimsy so it doesn't really hold. Every time I touch my hair it pulls those off my ear so I have to move my hair to get it back on...and when I do that I end up hitting the button which is right at the spot I need to push to get it into place. So I spend much of my brief train commute fussing with it...kind of annoying. At least the sound is acceptable otherwise I would have asked for a return.
5	:	"This is my second pair of SoundWhiz earphones (my first pair finally died after about two years of constant use). However, this is my first pair of ""turbo"" earbuds from this brand and I love them! I am very pleased with my purchase so far. The sound quality is great (as I expected) and they are very comfortable to wear. There were no issues connecting them quickly to my Bluetooth devices. I also love the carrying case and additional earbud alternatives provided. The customer service with this company is also great. Happy Customer!!"
5	:	"These headphones work really well. They stay connected even if my phone is across the house. The sound quality is great and they stay in my ears pretty well when I'm running. If I had to find a complaint, I suppose I'd say I wish the over ear part could be made smaller to fit more snugly against my ear, but I have pretty small ears and most of this type have jumped ship as soon as I start running. This set doesn't immediately bail when I run, so kudos to whoever designed them."
3	:	"The mic is not the best. I got these Bluetooth headphones with a mic because i needed the mic and good sound quality. I have to repeat things and yell in order for anyone to hear me, they pick up sooo much background noise that it drowns me out. So the mic works if i am in a quiet room, which is not good."
4	:	"Great product for the money! I lost a pair of running headphones (wired) that I've had for 6 years. I was hesitant to try something new but I need a pair quickly. I was very impressed with the sound when I first tried them and no longer have to blast the music on my phone. Also, love that I can rinse them off when I am done working out. I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because they do create sound wind noise when you run due to their size. But other than that I think they are a great product and would definitely recommend as a solid pair of wireless headphones for working out!"
4	:	"The customer service from this seller is amazing.  The set up was easy and good instructions provided.  I almost returned them because the sound is not all that great.  However after a few runs, it almost seems like they needed to be broken in, they sound a lot better.  They piece that wraps around the ear is a bit firm but they do stay in place.  I would say they are also a bit bulky around the ear.  Putting a head lamp over a beanie pushed the earphones down into my ear.  Pretty standard wrap around the ear headphones with excellent customer service."
4	:	"Just got those yesterday, so far the impression is totally positive.The best low-cost Bluetooth headphones I ever had. Excellent sound quality and immediate pairing with iPhone 7.I will soon add some activity - running - and edit my review accordingly.10/19/2017 Took away one star due to the poor quality of the case (see image). Otherwise, these are great headphones for running and for everyday usage."
5	:	Perfect for working out. Don't have to worry about them falling out. Happy with this purchase.
5	:	"I just got these SoundWhiz headphones, but so far I'm impressed.  They are super comfortable to wear - the ear hooks are soft and flexible, and they are comfortable in my ear as well.The sound is excellent.  I'm listening to Imogen Heap's Speak for yourself album, and Of Monsters and Men's My Head is an Animal - The sound is so clear and lovely.Pairing with my devices, iphone6+, mac mini and mac pro, was easy and fast."
1	:	I bought these as a Father???s Day gift for my husband. He has used them maybe 10 times while doing yard work and they have already stopped working properly. The Bluetooth constantly disconnects and reconnects which causes for a very unpleasant listening experience. It???s not his phone as my wireless headphones (different brand) stay connected just fine. Really wish his gift would of worked longer than 3 months.
5	:	"First things first, I think these are an incredible value.  They are comfortable, they sound great and the person on the other end of phone calls cannot tell that I am driving 70 mph down a highway with the top down on my Convertible.  There may be better wireless earbuds for people that want to use them for loud music; which these work fine for me, but for the price I would recommend these all day long ... Especially if you are using them as a wireless, hands free, Bluetooth head set.  My only recommendation to the seller would be to make the cord just a little longer.  But I am still easily giving these a 5 star rating."
4	:	"These headphones have been a welcome addition to remove the doldrums from monotonous treadmill running.  They provide an excellent sound quality with a good bass response, although perhaps too excellent as I've found they have been been loud (in a quiet room) at even the lowest sound level.  However, throw the background noise of a speedy treadmill motor, random grunts and growls,and the device seems to balance out wonderfully to remove even the constant odorous background advice from the hordes of post-holiday insta-fitness gurus.  Plus, the variety of included ear pieces should allow fit for even the most ogresque customer.  Therefore, do not hesitate to purchase this device, it will prove to please in these cold wintry months."
4	:	"I have only had the earbuds for a few days now, so I am still getting used to them . So far the sound and comfort is good. The ear hooks are a bit too big for my ears. It would be nice if the ear hooks were adjustable or if I had the option to switch from the over the ear hooks to the inside the ear hooks. Once again still learning all about them. Sound and comfort is very good."
5	:	Order these for my husband to wear while he is at the gym he is very particular about his headphones he wanted me to buy Bose headphones but since they are very expensive he had to settle for something a little less  expensive so I did some research and picked these and he is happy with them which says a lot for someone who is so picky.
2	:	"The quality of these headphones is fine, audio-wise. But the just don't fit right. Neither I nor my husband could get the over the ear part to stay in the right place... It kind of just floats there. I would have had to pay shipping to return, so my husband now uses them when mowing the lawn and no other time."
5	:	"I purchased these headphones for my husband after reading other reviews. He is an avid runner and an even more proficient  sweatter!  In the past 18 months, I have had to have his previous bluetooth head phones returned to the manufacturer 8 times.  They were the Apple beats wireless headphones. Their design lets the sweat run directly into the mechanisms and causes them to no longer turn off/on.  I waited to write my review until he had used them for multiple long runs in the warmer weather. The only minor adjustment was finding which ear buds worked best for him. He has come to find that the spongy black ones don't seem to slip out as easily when they get wet. He is very pleased at how well they work. I am very pleased to not have to sit on hold with customer service for hours waiting for a return approval code."
3	:	"Good sound but the construction is a little ""cheap"". I'm also not a fan of flat, plastic cords as they stick to your neck and sometimes pull the bud from your ear when you turn your head. If it was slightly longer, it might help. Overall, not a bad product for the price."
5	:	"These earbuds are great for working out, and stay in your ears even through lots of sweating! They provided a number of sizes of earbud caps so I was able to find a size that fit my small ears very well. One great feature is that the control is on the ear piece. Other Bluetooth earbuds seem to have a control mechanism on the cord and it pulls the earbud out while working out. Probably the best part of these is this company's customer service! I had lost the charging cable and simply emailed to see if I could get another one. They were very accommodating and now I'm back up and running with my SoundWhiz earbuds! Very happy with this purchase!"
5	:	"This was my first experience with wireless Bluetooth ear buds (necessitated by iPhone 7 with no headphone jack) and didn't really know what to expect. The reviews I read about these were all pretty good, so decided to give them a try. I'm very impressed with the sound quality, bass response, and the volume, all far better than I expected! Although I haven't worn them yet during any active activities, they seem to be comfortable and feel like they will stay in place. So far, I am very pleased with my purchase and think they are a really good value for the money!"
4	:	"This is my second Bluetooth running headset, and the SoundWhiz fixes everything that was wrong with the other brand. They fit great, and stay in place while running. The included earbuds of various sizes ensure you will get a good fit. The sound quality is much better than I expected in a headset, and they do cut down on road noise when you're on a run. And, finally, they pair easily to all of my devices."
1	:	So I???ve had these for about a month maybe a little less. I noticed recently that the sound quality has deteriorated in a month or less.Also the ear sling or the part that holds the headphones on the ear is very flimsy and does not help to keep them in your ears.
5	:	I use my headphones at the gym and running 5k races. The sound quality is exceptional! I sweat a lot too and it has never affected them.  I had an extended warranty when I bought my first  pair and made it almost the whole 2 years before they just wouldn???t turn on. I called customer service and within 5 days I had a replacement! Their customer service is top notch. They even emailed me to make sure I had received my replacements which also came  with another year warranty.  I???d recommend these to anyone!
5	:	"These things fit really, really well. I'm a pretty sensitive guy... I'M MAN ENOUGH TO ADMIT IT. I hate things that are too tight around my head, ears, whatever... But these don't cramp me one bit.So they fit well... But what about the sound?Oh, baby. Plenty down low. Clean up high. What more could you ask for?"
5	:	"These things are actually amazing for being 30 dollars, i bought them id say 3 or 4 months ago and they still last for days, they block out a lawn mower pretty well and they are the best headphones for quality i have. Also they dont fall out of your head ever, everyone hates that."
3	:	"The Headphones are okay.... Now... I'm comparing them to my ""Beats headphones"" that I purchased and were stolen. Simply put, the sound quality is totally different in my ears. They are convenient and comfortable.  Especially for working out.  They are totally worth the price.  If you don't want to spend the ""big bucks"" for similar headphones, then these are totally worth it."
5	:	"I purchased these to use at the gym so I didn't have to deal with headphone cords! They work great! They're easy to put on and super lightweight. I do a lot of treadmill and elliptical work so I'm constantly moving my body and they stay secured in my ears every time.And the sound is awesome! I've listened to music and movies through these headphones and it all sounds great!You also get a very nice little zippered hard-covered container to keep them in. I keep it in my gym bag all of the time. It gets packed and unpacked, thrown in my car, thrown into a gym locker and the container has held up nicely.I would highly recommend these wireless headphones, especially for the price!"
5	:	"Some people may prefer Beats, Bose, Sony or some other brand, but after having a previous pair of Soundwhiz (weird name, but still solid) I was ready to replace the first ones I lost. I undoubtedly will enjoy these headphones in the gym & on my walks."
4	:	"When I first reviewed this a few weeks ago, I wrote that this was a waste of money and did not work. The company sent me a replacement. However, it turned out that the original one just needed extra time to turn on, and to bluetooth. Give it more than several minutes of switching on and off, both the headphone and whatever you're using, in my case a cell phone, and it eventually worked."
5	:	Awesome .. Sound is awesome I use with my 5s in the city and worked flawlessly.. I have to get the fit down but bass is good and range is impressive.. I'm not a audiophile but work great! And they came a day early SCORE! The seller is really responsive and they hooked it up! Thanks team! And lifetime warranty .. Very happy with it
4	:	I bought these because in ear headphones usually fall out of my ear and the over the head ones give me a headache.  These have a great fit with many size options for the part that goes in your ear.  I love this design and how they hook over the top of your ear so they don't fall off!  They truly are noise canceling which is great.  The only reason I can't give five stars is because they don't give enough bass for my liking but solid headphones none the less.
5	:	"This is an awsome product. The sound is great and comes in loud and clear. The hooks are a soft material so they stay on better and dont hurt your ears. It comes with so many earbud sizes and they're not only small enough, but oblong enough to stay in your ears. I am so pleased with this purchase."
4	:	"Good ear fit, OK sound.I was originally unhappy with these headphones - the set they sent were defective. A few tries later, I have a pair that works.The only reason I give this 4 and not 5 stars is because I'm not super happy with bluetooth tech in general. I think theres still a long way to go in terms of making things as easy as plugging in a headphone jack. Sometimes I have to wait a minute or two for things to connect...not ok. But not this companies' fault!Also - A+++ customer service. They won't leave you hanging."
5	:	"They worked flawlessly for six months, but then one of the earbuds stopped working. I contacted customer service,  got a reply within hours and a new pair mailed out that day.  Within three days I had a new pair in my hands.  I chose these earbuds based on the customer service reviews and they did not let me down.  I just ordered another pair for my husband. You really can't go wrong!"
5	:	"This is It !!! And yeah they do stay in during cycling, MMA Cross Training, Fitness W/O Say What Yeah I Said It and That's A fact ! And the Sound Is really Quality Is Also Working It !Just Keeping It Real !"
1	:	I do not use these headphone a lot but when I do the sound shifts from one side to the other. I figured for just slightly moving your head the sound should not go in and out. Aren't these supposed to be workout headphones? Overall I would not buy again. Still on the hunt for decent wireless headphones.
5	:	"I love these headsets! I love music so much, so I can run, workout, do chores at home with my headsets on! the battery lasts for 3 days and that is I use it every day all day! it has a very good base sound. the price is reasonable for the quality. Get it for yourself!"
4	:	"I love having bluetooth headphones for labwork, these work well. I'm not an audio expert but the music quality is nice, really easy to connect to all your devices. My only complaints are that the fit is less than ideal if you have floppy, stick-out ears like I do :P and also the loud low battery message consistently spooks me while I'm listening to music. I've also accidentally redialed a lot with these headphones."
5	:	Great head phones. Easy setup. Would buy from this vendor again.Great customer service. I am one of those people who have a difficult time keeping ear phones in place. Well these stay in place9/12/16. Well I've had these phones for over a month. Talk about surround sound in an ear bud. I played a rain sound tape and I literally could hear the rain falling around my head. These phones have such clarity of sound! I have packed all my other phones to give away.
5	:	"I use my headphones when I'm working out, running or sometimes just working around the office.  The sound is great.The only thing I wish was improved was noise blocking.  It's really, really good, but I've had headphones that were a little better."
5	:	"I have been working out in these for over a week now - both outdoor running and hiking - and they work great. I love the over-the-ear design as they fit snugly and I don't have to worry about them falling off. The charge lasts a long time, and I never experience a ""bluetooth blip"" or gap in audio. I also sweat a lot and hopefully this won't be an issue over time. I have accidentally pressed the ""off"" button a couple times while trying to adjust the volume, but once you get used to it it's second nature adjusting them. Highly recommend these earbuds for running!"
4	:	"There's a lot of feedback noise whenever there's a breeze, and it gets really loud when running in certain directions in the breeze. I had to knot the wire up because it was too long, it would catch on my shirt collar and pull out of my ear or it would get pinned under the barbell when I put it on my shoulders to do squats. Sound quality is pretty good when there's no breeze."
5	:	"These are great!!  Super comfortable and stay put in my ears and the sound is fantastic!  Paired easily with my Fitbit Versa with no cutting out while walking.  Charged quickly too.  Can't comment as to how long the charge is as I haven't used them that long, but so far just great!"
3	:	Sound was great but not sure how anyone uses these for running. I returned them because they???d fall out of my ear after 4 or 5 strides.
5	:	Love them. I train MMA so boxing usually wiggles earbuds out in a second. These were holding on strong. Great sound qaulity and they pair with everything. Even my fitbit iconic.Will update after i try swimming. Yes i know your not supposed to but i want to see how water lroof they are.
5	:	This is my third pair like these. However the first two sets are dead to me and I love the soundwhiz turbos much better. My first impression was great another cheap ass set of b-tooth headphones. However I was too fast to judge them. First they are extremely light weight compared to other I've owned. Second you can rinse them off with water if needed. Whoa! Mind blown. Voice control over your phone with push button. Whoa mind blown again. finally I've gotten nothing but personal real person customer service. Keep it up guys I'm liking this
3	:	"So after a month of using it in the gym, it seems that the audio cuts off even more gradually during exercises. Could sweat be a factor of that? To give an idea; every time I go down for a squat, the audio starts to cut off. When I stand straight after the squat, audio goes back to normal. This also happens during running on the treadmill. Sadly its gotten more frequent. Good sound audio nonetheless!"
4	:	I have to say I???m impressed with these headphones. They have been able to hold up during my heavy sweat filled workouts. Unlike the similar looking expensive beats headphones which always failed after a few months or so. Sound on these are definitely okay for my workouts.  Although I???ve only had these since April I???d definitely give it a thumbs up rating. The only downside for me is that the ear part is designed for someone with big ears so I have to keep adjusting them so they won???t fall off when I run.
5	:	I love how they sound and how they fit.  Pairing to my device was easy and quick (totally different from other ear buds I've had).  I just got these so I'll update my review when I've had them a while to see how handle over the long run.
5	:	"Headphones are EXACTLY as described. My husband and I needed wireless headphones for the gym, and they are the best headphones we've used. So far they seem sweat resistant, and have better sound quality than the $150 pair we got at Verizon. Easy to set up and use. Plus they come with different inserts so they are extremely comfortable. We had issues with the delivery of the second pair, and the seller contacted us immediately to make sure we got what we needed. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND."
1	:	I bought these headphones to use with my Apple watch.  Something is wrong and they do not remain connected when the watch is on the left wrist when running.  It's like the range is limited and will only work if I put the watch on the right wrist.  Very irritating.  I had other wireless headphones for running and they worked find so I know it's my watch that is having the issue.I missed the return window so now I'm stuck with these.  I should have returned them right away but forgot.There are a lot of good reviews for these so I supposed I just got a bad set?
5	:	"These earphones are perfect for anyone. You can customize the earbud options to your size and material liking. They are very comfortable even on my big ears. The quality is so good I can hear new sounds on my favorite songs. I guess my only minor complaint is the bass on these earphones. The thumps are a little too loud on songs with lots of bass. The customer service is superb. They always check up on me to see if I am having any issues. For $31.97, this is a must buy. You probably won???t find earphones like these anytime soon."
5	:	"I've owned these for over a week and I'm very pleased.  The over the ear design ensures they stay in place and the ear buds fit into my ears nicely unlike many, many other ear buds I've owned.  Easy to use and the sound quality is much better than I've experienced previously too."
5	:	"I loved these headphone but they stopped being able to be recharged after just 6 months. So, I contacted the company through Amazon and I'm hoping to get them to provide me with a replacement because the company offers a 12 month warranty."
5	:	Love the wireless earbuds that is half the price of more expensive kinds. I enjoy these just as much. If you like to hear your bass in your songs for motivation when you work out then these are for you. Make sure you pick the right ear buds size or they won't stay in the ear. After a couple of month of use the right side of the headphones started to have intermittent sound. Call customer service and the shipping out a new pair right away. Back to my music. Very happy.
4	:	"Giving these a 4 and not a 5 due to the fact that they work nice but when at the gym and doing different exercises the cable sometimes gets caught on the back of my neck from being sweaty. When this happens they sometimes want to come out of my ears. The sounds is good but could be better ""I'm very picky when it comes to sound"" but I guess you get what you pay for and the size it works."
5	:	"I have this headphone since November 2017, I had not wanted to write anything about them until I let some time pass and be sure of what I was going to write.it's been more than 6 months, and for now, I can say that they have a good sound that is comfortable to use, It has a decent sound isolation and the battery lasts a long time. To my point of view, it seems good quality, I have had many headphones even the Samsung that I like but they have not lasted long. For now, I am happy with my purchase.If I change my mind I will make an update."
5	:	"I previously owned beats wireless headphones. They only last six months and I assume it's due to the moisture from my sweat when I worked out. These  being waterproof it was the perfect fit. These sound better than beats with very nice bass and sound clarity. In addition, the microphone is located on the earpiece and my friends have told me that they can hear me Crystal clear, better than they were able to hear me before. I recommend these headphones to everyone."
4	:	"Great battery life, good audio, good fit.  -1 star because *the microphone is terrible* and I can't really use this device for phone calls.  I tried it on 3 calls to 3 people on 2 different phones, and all reported an inability to hear me clearly enough to have a conversation.  That said, I got these for the earphone functionality which is good."
5	:	"Purchased as a gift, these BT headphones are perfect for my intended recipient. I will post more details once I've given her the gift, but the price was right. Product arrived early, exactly as described and I would recommend SoundWhiz for those looking to purchase good quality products at a fair price."
5	:	"These honestly surprised me with the quality in sound and the distance I can go from my phone. I absolutely love these for working out since I like to do aerobics and Yoga. I've never had an issue with them falling out or feeling uncomfortable either. Thank you very much, love this product!"
2	:	"I ordered these headphones because of the reviews but it turned out to be a disappointment. The sound quality is a bit muffled and when I???m on a call the person on the other end can barely hear me because of all the background noise. Another thing that surprised me was how flimsy the ear piece is, it feels like a soft piece of rubber, although it has no fallen of my ear yet I???m not sure how long it would last. I???ll definitely be shopping for another pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones soon."
5	:	"They sound great, good sound overall, I like the bass and that they cover the outside noise pretty well. very comfortable with both the rubber and foam buds. great for gym, long bus ride and in general."
5	:	Great buds for the price. If you keep your expectations in line with the price point you will he pleasantly surprised. These are not $200 buds lol. They are a bit big but relatively light and they stay in place and the sound quality is good. Battery life is great as well. Pairing was a snap.
5	:	"Worked great right out of the box! Still in the honeymoon phase, but if they last, they'll earn the 5 stars. I'm a musician and use professional grade IEMs on a weekly basis and, while the clarity is not quite as good (as expected) I am very impressed with the quality of the audio and overall quality the set."
2	:	"These are really great for when you are in the house.  Once you leave your home, all you hear is beeping and no one can hear you on the other end.  Assuming this is interference from other wireless devices. Not happy at all with this product."
5	:	"Inexpensive with a 1 year warranty. Works well, good range, good battery life, good volume. Bought this to replace another set of bluetooth headphones without a warranty that stopped working after a few months."
1	:	"Bought these as a Christmas present for my boyfriend who is an avid runner. He runs approximately 5 days a week. The headphones completely died out of the blue on March 31st - barely made it three months. They are so far from ""waterproof,"" as advertised, they aren't even sweat-proof! Super disappointing."
5	:	"These really work great. My girlfriend and I bought a couple of pairs to use while we workout together and could not be happier. I usually have a hard time with ear bud type headphones as they don't usually fit in my ears comfortably, but these come with plenty of different sizes and a foam earpiece that expands to fill the shape of your ear, really comfy. They look cool, the sound quality is awesome, and connect really easily to our phones. And no annoying wires in the way anymore! We ordered a third pair to gift to a friend. Highly recommend."
5	:	"I originally ordered a pair of Mpow Bluetooth headphones, but found that they fell out of my ears so easily, even without much movement. I remembered seeing this brand from an Instagram fitness account. She said great things about it, so I immediately ordered these. And honestly, they are amazing. They are very comfortable yet secure - I will definitely be running my next marathon in these. The controls are simple and the sound is great. I love that I don???t have to mess with them once they???re in. Perfect for running, HIIT training, anything. I wanted Beats before but see no point in spending so much because these are great!"
5	:	"I bought these due to the numerous positive reviews I'd seen on Amazon and, as it turns out, they weren't lies.  They are a low-priced upgrade over the pair of bluetooth headphone I had been using.  Sound quality is INFINITELY better.  I can actually hear music/shows while running on a treadmill with the volume ONLY half way.  With the previous pairs I'd owned, I needed to crank the volume WAY up.Also, the fit is comfortable and natural. They just conform to the head with ease.  Charging is quick and lasts for quite a while.All in all, you really CAN'T beat these for the price.  Great sound. Great quality. Great overall product!"
5	:	I have been wanting bluetooth headphones for awhile now to use while I run but was always hesitant to spend so much money on them until a friend requested these to me! I have been very pleased with no only the product and price but also the customer service! You can't beat $30 for bluetooth headphones and the quality does not disappoint. The setup is simple and the fact that it comes with several different ear buds allows for the perfect fit for optimal sound cancelling and sound. Very happy and will recommend to my friends and family!
5	:	"I have paid a lot more and gotten a lot less sound quality.  I take my Turbo cycling along the North Coast of America, also know as the South Shore of Lake Superior.  The battery lasts a long time, they are comfortable and the over-the-ear loop keeps them from going anywhere if you get on some really bumpy ground.  If I needed another pair, I'd buy these."
2	:	"I had an issue with my pair ""skipping"" during music playback. I thought the streaming music service was to blame, but my wired earbuds did not display the same problem. I opted to stick with my wired earbuds and returned these. The return process was simple and easy."
5	:	"I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality of these headphones.  Full, rich sound. Not tinny at all.  They are super comfortable to wear, even with my glasses.  I can hardly feel they???re there.  Very easy to pair too.  Highly recommended."
5	:	"These are probably the best earphones you can buy for the price. They're not audiophile earphones, but I needed earbuds that would stay put while running and that could delivered decent sound. And they do all of those very well. The BT connection is super easy and quick. The earbuds are very comfortable and stay in place no matter how much you shake you're head. There are like 7 different silicone/foam buds to play with and to adjust to your ears. The sound is very bass heavy but I like it that when I'm running because it gives me a power boost."
1	:	I purchased these earbuds in late July 2017. They worked for a while and then they stopped taking a charge. I tried different chargin cables but that did not help. I sent a message through Amazon asking that they be exchanged for new ones. I was supposed to have a response within two business days but it has been two weeks and I have not heard anything. I would not recommend these to anyone.
1	:	My left earbud has stopped working only the right side . How can I get a replacement? I did purchase the extended warranty. UPDATE my new Bluetooth arrived quickly and I am very happy with the service I received.  I am enjoying my Bluetooth again!!! 2.16.18 NEW UPDATE  My replacement has stopped working the same thing as before. The left earbud starts to break up the completely stops working. PLEASE HELP DO I NEED TO FIND A DIFFERENT TYPE?????
2	:	while the sound quality and Bluetooth are great the battery has completely died after just 3 months of use. There appears to be no breaks or cracks physically it just doesn???t want to charge or come on at all.
5	:	"Sound quality is amazing, I have to have the sound almost down to nothing, these work far better than I expected to be honest. I don't like ear bud style headsets of any kind, they have always been uncomfortable but these are comfortable. They are easy to use and  come with a great instruction manual."
5	:	"product arrived exactly as stated.  They fit great and do not bother behind my ears even with sunglasses in use.  There is a bit of a whistle when the wind is blowing, but not a major distraction.  Setting them up to work with my iPhone was very simple.  Follow up from SoundWhiz has been very good and unexpected."
5	:	"These were my headphones for months, they are great headphones and i truly loved the. Maybe after 2/3 months the ear piece that goes around your ear started to stretch a little more than i wanted. Other than that I've had no problems with them!"
5	:	"I LOVE THESE EARBUDS!  They arrived just when the retailer said they would.  The sound is great, and it has different sizes of cushions you can swap out for your own personal comfort.  The Earbuds were really easy to pair to my phone and tablet, and they are simple to use.  There was a slight problem when they stopped powering on.  I contacted the retailer to see if they could offer some trouble shooting tips, and they sent me a new pair!  ABSOLUTELY beyond what I expected, and it was great to know that SoundWhiz stands behind their product!  I would purchase these again for myself (if I ever needed), and for a friend for a gift.  I HEART THEM"
2	:	"Five months after buying them they only worked in one ear, and now, six months later they don't work at all.  I was very careful with them and they just didn't last as long as I thought they should."
5	:	"Awesome gadget. At first I thought the earpiece wasn't working, but I didn't turn the power on. Then It was connected to my phone and It couldn???t pair. I decided to restart my phone, and it has been excellent ever since. It took a little getting used to ( read the instructions first). I like that it tells the number thats calling. I also like that my car automatically picks up my phone???s bluetooth when I enter and the head set picks back up when I turn my car off. I love it so far.2/18 bought a second headset. I gave away the first one and I love it sooooo much that I bought another for myself."
5	:	This company is awesome. This is third set of headphones that I have had. I bought my first set and they quit working after about 8 months and they sent me a new pair no questions asked. The second pair were broke by accident and I just received my third pair. They are the most comfortable and trust me I have tried everything from Beats to cheap knockoffs and these are the best. They are light and comfortable and the sound quality is fantastic. I highly recommend SoundWhiz.
5	:	"Fantastic product! I ordered a pair of these 4 months ago and was immediately impressed - There was a strange and uncommon flaw in that pair and the guys at SoundWhiz promptly responded to my warranty email. They were very helpful and timely.Between my original pair and the new set I tried the Beats 3 (over 3x the price). The Beats they were really quiet, less battery capability, and not as comfortable.The only thing I would change is I wish that they came with an extra cord manager piece. If I had 2 of those then I could double back on the cord and make it a little more practical."
2	:	"I have to redact my previous review. I'm so bummed about this because I really enjoyed my headphones for the price I got it for. The sound quality was amazing and the Bluetooth connection was simple. Unfortunately, I don't think it has great sweat protection. I only use these headphones while working out and last Thursday they completely went dead. Less,than 30 days of purchase.  (Yes, they are fully charged) The headphones will not turn on. Again, I am so bummed about this. I was hoping to purchase one for my son for Christmas but that will not happen."
4	:	"The sound is excellent especially for the cost. Their website often has codes for additional savings from Amazon purchases. There are three buttons on the right ear to control sound, forward, backwards, calling, etc. The package comes with all the different fittings for your ear canal size. It is packaged with a nice case. This gets 4 stars because the fitting on the ears can be awkward and I don't believe these ear phones are as cleanly designed and feature rich as the Plantronics BackBeat Fit, but that pair costs much more than double.  For the majority of people, this pair of headphones will be a great buy and you will be very satisfied."
5	:	"These headphones sound amazing. Very clear sound, a lot of bass and very loud which is everything I look for in headphones. As a bonus they have a mic to use as a headset. I have bought a few headsets and these headphones blow those out of the water. The sound quality, comfort and bluetooth range are far superior to the headsets I have bough in the past. Other headsets I have had to constantly adjust to keep in my ear and the hard clips around the ear were uncomfortable/painful at times. These headphones I never had to adjust once in the hour and a half phone conversation I had last night and the soft over the ear clip was very comfortable. I would and probably will buy from SoundWhiz  the next time I buy headphones."
5	:	"I have a pair of Beats (very similar to these), which I bought for $199 a year and a half ago. Saw those on Amazon Lightning Deals, had no high expectations, but the price seemed so ridiculously low that...well,  there was nothing to lose. They turned out ABSOLUTELY GREAT! The Beats cannot beat them!"
5	:	"I've been wanting to write this review for awhile now but just haven't found the time.  These wireless headphones are absolutely the best I've ever owned... the sound is clear, crisp and hooking them up is easy. I run and they stay secure withought coming out (you all know what I mean.). I highly recommend these and plan on sticking with the Soundwhiz brand based on my experience."
2	:	"I really Like the fit and look of these headphones, however - the Bluetooth connectivity seems to be a struggle.  My headphones will stutter the sound quite a bit with the phone close (in a carrier for running) or in a pocket.  It doens???t happen all the time, but it does happen enough to make it incredibly frustrating.  None of my other headphones, Apple, Crown E-7, or Running Buddy have this issue - thus I know it is a problem with the headphones.  Based on other reviews - it appears this may be an isolated issue."
3	:	"Sound is a strong positive. Loud, strong bass and wide range. If you are using indoors, they are a great buy. However, if you exercise outdoor, one big caution. They are terrible in windy conditions. There is something with the design that amplifies wind noise as the winds flows over and through the ear buds. It renders the music unenjoyable and voice calls are incoherent."
4	:	"Sounds very good.  I had slight problems getting these headphones to pair with my IPod, but the fit is good, and the sound is good.  There are multiple earbud fittings to make sure that the headphones will be comfortable."
5	:	"I have been using these headphones for quite a while and really like them. They are comfortable to wear, good should quality (at least in my opinion), and pretty good battery life."
5	:	"This is the second time I have purchased these, and only because I lost my first pair. I am obsessed with these headphones. I wear them when I run, they successfully survived a rainy winter, and the battery lasts for about 7 hours before they need to be charged again. They stay in place, the music sounds perfect, and it is easy to switch songs. I highly recommend!!"
5	:	"I lost my original pair and replaced them with a pair of Arisen Phantoms, to which I can say is a real disappointing pair of headphones. After a week I returned the phantoms and got a second pair of these guys. Everything you want in a pair of workout headphones that are great quality for a great price. Functionally the sound is crisp and clear and I never have any connectivity issues pairing to my phone. The matt black/red is a great color too. Would highly recommend these headphones for those looking for a good pair of headphones to workout in or for commuting around town!"
5	:	"Once you can figure them out, they are a great buy for the price. I had the expensive versions of these since they were a brand new concept. When those wore out, I tried this economical brand instead.  I???m happy!"
4	:	"Package arrived on schedule and completely working. Already used it at the gym and sound was clear and constant. No issues with sweat or falling out of my ears from jogging or doing basic leg/arm workouts. Used this with spotify and it all worked good. No negatives at this point other than what I have heard from other users, depending on how you put the earbuds in the included carrying case, it can be easy to accidentally turn them on by squeezing the case. To fix this, just adjust the earbuds so that the on/off switch is facing upwards and it should not be possible to accidentally turn them on!"
5	:	"Update: my initial post gave them 1-star because they stopped working properly after 4 months. However, the company contacted me and sent me a new pair. I LOVE LOVE these headphones. I think I received a defective pair BUT the company sent me new ones at no cost to me. They were very apologetic and HONESTLY the headphones work great! My husband bought a pair at the same time he bought the first pair and he hasn't had any issues with his."
1	:	"They dont stay on my ears once I sweat. The ear loop doesnt even touch my ear because its too big, so basically the big piece that sits in your ear is the only thing holding it in place. Once I sweat they fall out. Very annoying. Will not buy again."
1	:	Used these with my cell phone for about three weeks.  Then they started buzzing and dropping calls.  Piece of crap.  Don't waste your money.
3	:	"They worked great for long bike rides for 6 months. Used daily for 20 mile each way bike commute to work.  Then the left speaker started to get fuzzy at times. Taped the cord, trying to reinforce it. Nothing happened. Right side still okay, can still make calls and use buttons, but left side very staticky."
4	:	"Great head phones for the price! Sound is amazing! It changed the way I run- the high quality sound makes my running much more efficient and enjoyable. The one problem I have is when I turn my head sometimes the sound goes in and out. However, the headphones come with a year warranty so if the problem continues I will contact the company. Overall satisfied."
5	:	"I bought two Soundwhiz Turbo Bluetooth Headsets, after diligent research. They are so comfortable around the ear, you'd forget that they're even there! Very easy to set up and use. It was a really good deal here on Amazon. The quality of sound is far greater than I expected. I would definitely buy again."
4	:	Great headset. Sound is better then old lg headset. The only issue I have is that now after 5 months it just shuts off with our warning. Battery is fully charged. I would buy more for friends and family. But that's the only reason I will looks for another pair of headsets that dont have these issues.
5	:	This product is easily better than my wireless beats3 they have withstood many sweaty adventures to the gym and cardio sessions. The only downside to these amazingly cheap but high quality headphones is the ear piece that keeps the headphones snug to your ear. It???s kinda flimsy and not as firm as I would like it feels like the headphones will fall out (it hasn???t happened) but feels like it. Overall though extremely satisfied customer of this product.
5	:	I absolutely love these.  The sound is awesome and the noise cancellation is unreal and unexpected for these types of headphones.I initially bought these because I was looking for workout headphone that were water resistant.  They've become my default headphone and I've recommended them to others who enjoy them.
5	:	"Great idea to include an expanded selection of earbuds. Able to find a perfect fit. Sound quality is excellent and comfort means I don???t know they???re there. Great for workouts or working in my home office - blocking out background noise and letting me listen in peace!Service has been excellent - easy warranty set up, video from a co-founder on how to get the best from the product.This is a forward looking company that is using technology wisely."
5	:	"The sound is good, the comfort as well. Battery life is good, as expected. My only critique is I don't really care for the controls on the earpiece itself, but other than that I'd give it full marks."
4	:	I had to try out a few headsets before i found this one! They fit in my ears and dont fall out when running which is my favorite thing about them. The sound quality is good and easy to connect to my phone. Also comes with a nice case to put them in. Only downfall i have is the cord is oddly shaped and i have to pin it in my hair when running so it doesnt hit the sides of my neck
1	:	"Only lasted 3 months and already breaking.  Keep disconnecting, turning on/off. Terrible reliability."
4	:	"These headphones are good for the low-cost. I chose them due to all the extra accessories. My headphones were always falling out of my ears while running but, when I use the foam tips, they stay in place. I do think the foam somewhat distorts the sound quality but, I'd rather keep my headphones in my ears than be picky about the sound. Overall it's a good pair of headphones for a reasonable price."
1	:	Sounds like listening to music underwater.  Has a distinct muffled sound with no mid or highs.  Tried using different settings on my iPhone 7's built in EQ with no improvement.  Found a pair of JBL Reflect Mini BT's at TJ Maxx for the same price as these.  The JBLs are heads and shoulders above the SoundWhiz with crystal clear vocals and mid range.  Sorry I purchased the SoundWhiz - look elsewhere.
5	:	"Love it!!! Perfect for working out or general chores. Started using kettlebell and these are perfect for exercises that require total body movement. So happy with these so far! My former wired headsets are now a thing of the past. I just purchased these and could not be happier,I hope in time I can write another review and also say these are sturdy and last long! We shall see!"
5	:	"Very easy to use, came with a partial charge so they could be set up right away. I didn't have any trouble linking to my phone (Android), comfortable to wear and have a good sound. They come with extra covers for the ear piece and a nice storage case."
3	:	"Music tends to cut in and out while I'm running, unless I'm on a treadmill with a stationary signal source."
2	:	"These are constantly falling off my ears while running. You'd think the over ear feature would at least keep them on your head but they just fall off anyway, even while walking around. Idk what they're talking about with this ""locking"" feature either."
5	:	LOVE THESE!!! They have made my workouts so much better since I don't have to worry about a long cord getting in my way. Only complaint is that they don't give me much warning when they are going to die.. I think I had maybe 20 minutes after the first notification.. meaning I had about an hour long workout with no music! But I've learned my lesson to always keep them charged so that doesn't happen again.
4	:	"I ordered these a few months ago.They work amazing! I use them to work out and had no issues the first few months.  Unfortunately they were a faulty set and stopped working after a couple of months.  However, SoundWhiz has amazing customer service. As soon as they found out about my issue, they rectified the situation. I got a replacement set of headsets within a week! My new set works great as well! Thank you SoundWhiz for your amazing customer service!"
2	:	"We bought 2 pair in July 2017 for working out. Loved them at first.. now one pair won't charge, or turn on. We really like them, but not if they're going to go bad after less than 2 months. Since they're so new, is there any recourse do get a replacement pair?"
5	:	I've purchased two sets of these headphones. One set in July and one set in August. I'm very happy with the product I received. The inclusion of multiple ear bud sizes as well as foam + regular is fantastic. The outside noise reduction for the foam earbuds is very good. It doesn't cut out all sound but most of the noise is restricted to reasonable levels.
5	:	I've been using these for a about a week now. Very good sound. They stay in your ears without any problems. They were very easy to connect to blue tooth. I cannot be happier for the price I paid!
3	:	"These headphones are nowhere near noise-cancelling. My dad, who is hard of hearing, put them on and talked about how well he could still hear everyone (he didn't know they were supposed to be noise cancelling).The sound quality is poor to average. They are worth about $30, just don't expect any noise cancelling."
5	:	Works well and survives to working out and getting a little wet. Plenty of ear pieces for comfort and the battery stays charged even after periods of not using it.
5	:	"Very happy customer! Prior to this order, I ordered the wrong Bluetooth earbuds (BluePhonic) which my son was happy with, but when we got the correct Soundwhiz... he compared and like the Soundwhiz better for 2 things... the over the ear piece was softer and more flexible and he felt the sound was more distinct with Soundwhiz. He's very happy that I corrected the order. Thank You!"
1	:	I had to return them because the parts that's supposed to hold them onto my ears were way too big and couldn't be adjusted. They wouldn't Stay in
5	:	"I was looking at wireless headphones on Amazon and came across SoundWhiz bluetooth headphones.......after I read the reviews about this headphones, I placed an order. WOW......I was surprised with the quality of the sound, it's clear and believe it or not you can actually hear the bass sound. And, not too mention the customer support is excellent. Overall, I'm very happy with this product........great price with a great sounds!  Thank you!"
5	:	I love these head phones. They are easy to sync with any device. They are very loud and have ear buds to fit all size ears comfortably. I would definitely recommend these to everyone for them self or as a gift.
5	:	"I have so many headphones I could open a store but I don't like the way any of them feel in my ears.  So then I bought a wireless over the ear set of headphones which were great but much too bulky to carry on my commute each day.  These headphones are comfortable, very portable and have a great sound.  I'm thrilled with my purchase!"
4	:	"I only just started using these so I can't speak to durability yet but they were very easy to set up and use.  They do stay in my ear, however, the placement of the power button isn't ideal as I tend to turn them off when placing them in my right ear.  I'm hoping I will get used to it."
5	:	"I am OBSESSED! The sound quality of these is amazing, they don't ever slip out of my ears! I have had many headphones that fall out in the past, so I was very worried about that! I tried the AirPods right before I received these in the mail, and these blow the AirPods out of the water with sound quality and comfort in my ear. I use them a ton for my sweaty workouts and they have been a game changer!"
2	:	"they sound great, when they stay on my ears, but they fall out while I walk. so I don't even bother to use them when I run."
5	:	"No complaints here. Haven't had it very long, but so far they are great. Sound quality is good, fit is good, distance from BT source is good. The charge is really good too, I feel I have to charge mine maybe once a week at most. Granted that's only about 8 hours max listening through the week from gyming. Almost got bose versions, but the reviews for these won me over. Plus come on, the price. Recommended."
1	:	Only worked a couple on months then wouldn't charge anymore.
4	:	Good value combining high quality fit with competitive price. Easy to use and comfy fit. Sometimes the wire gets caught on my tshirt collar or sweaty neck.
5	:	"This Bluetooth headset is fantastic. This is the first sport/workout Bluetooth headset I have purchased so I have no source of comparison. I have used it a few times when working out and love how comfortable the fit is.  I use a circuit fitness routine that includes running on a treadmill, pushups, pull-ups, crunches and dumbbell curls and lateral raises.  The headset stays in place no matter what I am doing.Summary:- Great Sound- Nice fit- Good battery life- Easy to pair- Well made & durable (water resistant)- Reasonable priced"
5	:	"I ordered these because I was tired of the headphone cord getting in my way while trying to work out.  Not only do I no longer have that cord in the way, but I don't have to strap my phone to me.  I can just set it down and out of the way.  These eliminated both restrictions.  The sound is great, and they're very easy to set up and use.  I got them in pink and love them!"
3	:	"They're not bad. I couldn't really find an ear attachment that I liked... they either were too tight or started to fall out when I ran.  They're okay though,  maybe I just need to modify them a little. Sound quality is ""okay,"" not the clearest, but I don't really care; they're just used for running."
4	:	These Bluetooth earbuds are good. I wish they had a shirt clip to help keep  in place. The battery life could be better. So far my wife likes them. Sometimes they will start your music when watching another app or video. The Bluetooth connection is good.
5	:	This is my first wireless headphone purchase. These are freaking amazing. They fit snuggly in my ears. I was able to wear sunglasses and a visor without any discombobulation. I can believe I waited so long to give up my dreadful plug ins!!!
4	:	Love that they stay in even when running. Range is all right wish it was a bit farther. Sound is good and block out of. I use pretty good.
5	:	I had an issue with the first pair charging and keeping a charge.  I was sent a new pair and have had no issues. I love the headphones. They are lightweight and comfortable.  I work outside in the yard/garden a lot and it's great not having to deal with dangling cords. No need to spend big dollars- this pair will do you right and so will the seller if there is a problem!
5	:	Purchased first set and they unfortunately stopped working. Contacted customer service and they shipped a replacement so fast I think it arrived before I hung up the phone. I received several follow up emails from SoundWhiz inquiring how things were going and whether the replacement set was working. They really care about customer support and take it seriously - that's refreshing and very appreciated. I wish this company could provide customer service training seminars for others!
5	:	Love these BT buds and I know you will too!Price was great and sound is even better. Don't even bother to look any further you will love these.
4	:	"Great headphones for the price. This is my first venture into wireless headphones, and I am quite pleased with them. The only reason I give 4 stars is that the ear support thing over the top of the ear is not adjustable. Thus, it mainly relies on the friction between your ear canal and the ear price to keep them in your ear. Other that that they are great, the base is awesome and really help to get me into my workouts."
5	:	"awesome sound Yes they got attitude!only this i have realised is when i hang the cord behind my neck they tend to come off my ears,but when i hang it in front they sound better.....so which is the right way to wear them?GREAT GREAT SOUND....NO WAT TO WORK OUT WITHOUT THEM!Plus i love there follow up with the buyers good job guys"
1	:	These worked great initially.. went on vacation and they were unused for a couple of weeks- now they won???t turn on. I thought maybe they just needed a charge so I charged them- still nothing ???
5	:	"Very impressed with the quality of the headphones. The seller even sent me an email with helpful tips to get the bluetooth connected. They come with a case and everything is so light weight, I will look inside the case to make sure I put the headphones back in there. Great buy so far."
2	:	"These ""were"" some of the best workout/running headphones I have purchased! My wife used them for running and I used at the gym. The sound quality was an 8/10 and were comfortable. I bought on June 5th 2017 and on August 22nd 2017 I grabbed them from the charger and the button felt different(5:00am), I turned the lights on and saw that these had actually melted while on the charger. Scared me as they were sitting beside papers that could have caught fire and caused major damage. I know companies are having issues with Lithium Ion Batteries and recalling bad products, haven't seen any recalls from SoundWhiz. ??? Really disappointed"
5	:	"In fact, the best customer service experience I've ever had. The product works very well for the price (namely sound quality and battery life). After a few months, it began to act buggy, but the complimentary warranty covered a replacement and Jo with SoundWhiz went above and beyond to ensure I was satisfied with the replacement. This included emailing me back at 10 pm on a Sunday. I will purchase SoundWhiz again because of this experience."
1	:	"Updated review: I have literally only used these twice. The day I bought them when I was completely blown away with the quality and clarity. Then today the second  time I used them it was constantly cutting out. :( tried pairing to multiple devices since I figured, hey maybe it???s just my phone. However the issue kept happening. My phone was literally in my lap so they were definitely in range. Very disappointed I originally loved these upon first trying them and had such high hopes. I love the color of these and the sound quality is amazing! Seriously I???m blown away at the sound quality. I love all the different ear pad accessories that come with it so I can find the perfect fit. And I like the case it comes with"
1	:	"These were a temporary solution for wireless audio to go with a gifted Apple watch, but even for that purpose they were very flimsy and did not fit well.  I returned them."
5	:	"Love these earbuds. It was a little difficult finding earbuds with a low enough frequency response. These listed the low end as 20Hz, so they have a good bass response for earbuds. I like my classic rock with a good sound. Paired to phone in seconds. Had an issue pairing to Kindle, but support responded quickly and fixed the issue. Comes with 3 sizes of silicone and foam earbuds."
4	:	When it came time for me to get a new set of wireless headphones I was expecting to have to pay $100 or more for quality sound. I was shocked and somewhat skeptical when I read the reviews but I decided to try it for myself. I'm extremely pleased! The ear phones are comfortable and the sound is very clear. People with whom I am speaking also report very good sound with very little background noise.
5	:	"My husband bought these for me after some failed choices before. I normally hate around the ear, but I don't feel these. I also don't feel the cord on my neck as I run. The sounds is great and it's easy to pair and use. I loved it so much he bought himself a pair. The case is also great to keep them from getting ruined."
4	:	"Surprisingly incredible sound quality for the price, multiple ear pieces for perfect fit, only thing that would make this product perfect was if the outer ear piece would hug the ear tighter or have the option to but definitely worth it!"
3	:	Got these  around a month in a half ago. The main selling point was the fact that they're sweat proof. I've been only taking them to the gym and keeping good care of them but they all of a sudden won't charge and won't tun on. I loved the sound and feel of the headphones. I hope theres something you can do for me.
5	:	"Excellent headphones! The sound quality is really superb and all the features work as they should. They are comfortable to wear all day long and have all the accessories you need to suit your ear canals, to charge and to store them away safely."
1	:	"These are terrible.  Won't hold a charge, even though turned off.  I was able to these once & they never worked again.  I thought I was doing something wrong, but I'm sure these are defective.  Now it's too late to return."
2	:	"These sound great and hold a really long charge. They slide around my ear when I run. The hook is attempting to be lightweight but in reality, it doesn???t do much. I would like it if the ear hooks were hard plastic and not soft rubber."
5	:	"These headphones are remarkable. Long battery life, high sound quality and reasonably priced. I switched from Bose in ear headphones to these and honestly feel that these are an upgrade. The customer service is phenomenal as well. My first pair had someIssues and a replacement was shipped very quickly. Couldn???t be more satisfied with the company or the product."
5	:	These are amazing. I lost my last pair and these where well reviewed and had a competitive price. The sound is clear and they adjust sound level easily. They are comfortable in your ears and have different options for ear inserts.
5	:	"These are very comfortable! I am a smaller person and my ears are small and the extra small earbuds are perfect! I have t tried working out with them yet, but for listening to music while doing chores they???re amazing!"
5	:	Overall I think this is a great product. I wasn't sure if these were going to work at first as they kept falling out of my ear. But I changed the size of the ear bud and figured out that you have to turn the ear buds all the way back so it fits snuggly. I use these for running and the second time around they worked great. And I wore these with sunglasses and didn't have a problem.
4	:	My husband and I really like them. They have already saved my sanity.The only complaint is they aren't comfortable to wear while wearing his full face helmet.
5	:	Fits very secure in your ear. Comes with additional ear pieces to fit a variety of ear sizes. Micro USB charges an onboard battery. Around 6 hrs between charges. You can control your music by skipping tracks and controlling volume. Can also receive or deny calls. Bluetooth function hooked up without issue.
5	:	"Unbelievable!  When they arrived they felt so light I thought to myself, I am a fool to think these could replace my $150 Bluetooth headphones but before I return them I suppose I should at least try them.......They sound absolutely positively incredible.  What else could you want?  As soon as Amazon is restocked I'm ordering several more for friends and family."
1	:	Great sound..and feel easy to pair to your music source..my only issue which i feel is a BIG one the volume botton fell off...thought i could just pop it back in but cant..
4	:	"I bought these so I could listen to my audiobooks while doing water aerobics in the pool. The sound quality is good, and loud enough to be heard over the splashing water in the pool. I don't know why, but the left ear piece fits more securely than the right, but both have stayed securely in my ears during my exercises. I just leave my phone on the pool deck and can hear from anywhere in the pool. 4 stars because of the fit in my right ear."
5	:	Works great and sound quality isn't bad at all for the price. Thank you. Idk why we have to add so many words on a review just to submit it.
5	:	"Great bluetooth headphones. Comfortable to use and excellent sound quality for a low price. I used mine several times a week for workouts and runs until it stopped turning on or charging. I emailed customer support and they immediately responded and told me my product was still under warranty. They offered to ship me a replacement with expedited shipping. 3 days later, my package arrived with a new set of headphones.Great product, even better customer service."
1	:	My son had these for about 6 weeks and had only used the a handful of times to go running.  Then they wouldn't hold a charge at all.  There was no way to process a return on Amazon.  Entered feedback to the seller 10 days ago and have not heard back :-/
5	:	"I bought these for my son in college and he LOVES them! They do a great job of blocking out sound and it's great that they are waterproof because he doesn't have to worry about wearing them on campus when he gets stuck in the rain or snow. Great warranty, too. I highly recommend them!"
5	:	I enjoyed mine so much that I bought one for my I! Decent bass for the price. Works well for running or strength training.
5	:	"The quality of these headphones are superb! They fit well, come with a case and extra ear buds, and has nice features to include an easy on and off button that also tells you that it is turning the device on or off. The customer service is also great. I received a reminder email to also register my decode for my 1 year warranty.  Big question will be if this device holds up in the long run, but I have a feeling that it will last for awhile!"
4	:	Great! Very light and efficient the foam buds are really good but the other ones are not fitting the way the foam does. It need one more larger size. And then I would give all the stars. To try I ran 4 miles and I did not to re-fit them even once!! Good purchase !!
5	:	"HE PROBADO MUCHOS AUDIFONOS DEPORTIVOS DESDE HACE UN TIEMPO Y POR MUCHO ESTOS TIENEN UNA GRAN CALIDAD DE SONIDO, SON A PRUEBA DE AGUA Y SE VEN GENIAL. EL PESO DE LOS AUDIFONOS LOS HACE COMODOS Y TODOS LOS ACCESSORIOS QUE VIENEN INCLUIDOS POR EL PRECIO LO HACEN MUY BUENA COMPRA"
2	:	"has trouble connecting.  Also, when I first connect it, every time, it beeps every couple seconds so I have to turn it off and back on again."
5	:	"More like 4.5 out of 5 stars. Just rounded to give it 5. Great earbuds; sweat proof. I can go through layup lines before a game and not have these move at all. Sprinting, plyos, lifting, you name it, these got you covered. Sound could be better, but you can hear everything when listening to music or talking on the phone so it gets the job done. Speaker is phenomenal BTW when talking. Bluetooth range can be improved too, but I'm nitpicking at this point. Hopefully they're durable. They do come w/ a free warranty if you sign up on the Soundwhiz website."
5	:	"Love the sound. Very easy to use and although they are a tiny bit large for my ears, they do not fall off and are very comfortable."
5	:	"Love these headphones! No issues connecting the Bluetooth to either my Iphone, Ipad or laptop(PC). I love that they stay in my ears no matter what. Exercising, cleaning house, cooking or running errands, they don't budge. I have a few nontraditional ear-piercings that often cause problems with in-ear ear buds--but not these, they fit add don't fall out. They're perfect!"
1	:	I bought the head phones a month. I loved them but out of no where they stop charging. I am very  disappointed tried to contact seller no luck!
5	:	"WOW!! I actually bought these looking for anything better than the jbl's I paid $99 for which left tons to be desired.  I had also bought another pair Called Taotronics from here.  Not even a close comparison! I am shocked that even after having Bluetooth beats these kick the crap out of all of them!  I use them at the gym and every pair I had in the past when paired with my iPod isn't loud enough to cover up the crap they play at my gym.  Secondly the range was spotty with the headset on and the iPod in my front pocket of my shorts.  Base is plentiful, mids good, lows good hell im no expert but I damn sure can say get these they are worth a C Note all day long....can't believe it!"
2	:	These do not stay in ears when doing cardio activities. I have to keep adjusting them and it throws off my workout. The sound quality is ok at Best.
5	:	We bought this for our 20 yr old son for Christmas.  He says the noise canceling feature is awesome...so we will have to yell his name when we need him (lol)  So far he really likes these!!!
4	:	They work they do not sound clear at all and they echo and cut out when you talk to people..Update got a new pair from customer service I didn't even email them and they have sent me a new pair.  All is well now gues I got a bad one they sound decent don't expect bose quality but it's good and they are rain and sweat resistant I got caught in a bad rain storm while working out and they just kept working.
1	:	The battery is running out very quickly I charged it all night and by the middle of the day its on low battery.
2	:	The product worked great for first few months but it has not stopped working. I put it on the charger but no light comes on to show its charging and it won't turn on at all. I tried resetting it but nothing seems to work. I use it for moderate exercise. I have not dropped it or caused any damage to it. I put it on the charger one night and the next day it wouldn't turn on. I'm bummed cause it did have good sound.
1	:	Worked for a month then wouldn't turn on despite numerous attempts at charging.  It appeared to take a charge but just didn't work.
1	:	"Read a review in another site and bought them.They are the bomb. Sound quality is great. It was easy to pair with my IPhone and Ionic Fitbit.You can tailor the ear pieces. They are flexible and comfortable???either running, weightlifting or in the sauna to relax.The case is a nice touch and I throw it in my gym bag and go.EDIT: Hold the phone. It is not keeping a charge. I have had the product for 7 Days???  I am going to Re-evaluate. I have listened to 20 songs and lightly tested it in those environments mentioned above. If it screws up???sending it back and getting refund.VERY NERVOUS!!!! Jo, please read this and hit me up.NEW EDIT: The headphones hold a charge and work great.  Customer service is exceptional.  Lets see if the hold up!!!!May 11th:  First race. POS. Literally.DO NOT BUY THIS. They sent me another pair???very cool.That said, during the race, I had to repair the connection.  Tried my iPhone and my fit bit ionic. During a RACE.I am not pleased. Fix the technology. It worked great. It then I had to run with my Fitbit hand on my heart.This is in the trash. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
5	:	I love these Bluetooth headphones!! I use them everyday when I jog. Yes they are waterproof. The sound quality is really good as well and they look cool! Unfortunately I was having issues with the first pair of headphones I received. The battery wasn't lasting as much as it was supposed to. I got in touch with customer service and they sent me a new pair right away! No hassle! They were quick to respond to my emails. I really liked that and I appreciate that they do care! Thank you soundwhiz!
5	:	"Very good sound, easy to configure and use. Big plus no more wires!!"
4	:	"Headphones are a bit confusing to wear at first (in order to fit properly), but after you get the hang of it, they are great!  The sound quality is amazing, and they are very secure when I'm running.  If you're looking for less expensive replacement headphones for Beats or Apple Airpods, I would highly recommend these."
5	:	"Just received my SoundWhiz bluetooth earbuds. They sound excellent for the price and easily paired to my phone. The actually stay in my ears while on the elliptical machine. Which my old ones where constantly falling out. Item comes with several different size ear peices to fit different size ears. Hopefully, they will not fall apart like the previous reviews. I love them!!"
5	:	I bought these phones for my wife and I a year and half ago. The sound is great and not having the wire is stylin'. Connectivity was really simple to my iPhone. My 85 year old mom in law listened to em and we had to buy a third pair right away!
5	:	"They fit great and have wonderful sound quality. They come with many different sized ear buds too, which is great if you have small ears like me! The  black and silver look really nice as well. Definitely recommend!"
4	:	"This is my second set of head phones, the first were stolen at my gym. I have never had an issue with these. If I would give an constructive criticism,  I would say, they could be a little smaller and clip better to the ear, as you sweat they sometimes fall off, but over all a very good headphones!"
5	:	"I just received this, and tried them out yesterday on a walk.  They worked great!  There was almost no-setup needed aside from pairing it to my phone, and they were very comfortable after wearing them for about an hour!I can't speak for battery life yet, but they were still going strong today."
1	:	Purchased May 29th and received them June 1st and they officially stopped working the first week of August! Fully charged but will not turn on. When I put them on the charger the light no longer comes on. Prior to this I loved them. Quite saddening! Used them everyday at the gym. Ridiculous that they only lasted for two months of use. Guess they aren???t so sweat proof is the only thing I can think of. :(
5	:	"I enjoyed this product. It is affordable, works really well, and its a great fit in the ear. Great for use in the gym. Unfortunately, my product did stop working after 2 months. However, Soundwhiz has great customer service and they have been very accommodating. I will continue to purchase products from this company!"
5	:	"Perfect wireless headphone. Has all the features necessary on the earphone so you do not have to keep going back to your device if you have to change music, raise up the volume, or even make a call, for example. Blocks the sound pretty well, was working out in a full gym and could not here anything that was going on around me. The price is amazing for the product that you get. On top of that seller gets in touch with you through email to make sure you got everything."
5	:	"I was looking for a pair of simple headphones that I could use working out, and these do the job wonderfully! I like that it came with extra headphones too. They arrived early in the mail and the warranty was easy to setup as well!"
4	:	If you are looking for something that is on the same level as Beats or Bose then keep looking.  I love my URBeats but I wanted to get something that was wireless.  These have really good sound but the bass is not the same as the beats.  I wasn't looking for something to blow my eardrums but if youre  looking for something inexpensive and that sounds great then these are a great option.  I am happy with my purchase.
5	:	If you are training where your running or doing some kick boxing then these are for you . they have great sound and are secured !  not only that they are water resistant !
5	:	"I???ve been trying to find a pair of Bluetooth ear buds that don???t cost a fortune with decent sound. These offer Excellent fit and comfort with clear, clean highs and warm lows. The ear hooks make them stay in even when I exercise. Buy them to believe them."
5	:	SoundWhiz earphones fit well (work for my 10 year old son and myself). Sound quality and microphone + are great. Bluetooth easy to use with Android phone.
5	:	Still getting use to the fit. Sound is good. I use to watch Netflix on iPad and there is no lag time like with some Bluetooth. Easy to charge. Answering the phone is easy as is volume up and down. For the money I would buy again.
5	:	"I have owned some pretty good headphones/ ear buds, including Sure, Bose, and other mid to high end, though the sound quality isn???t quiet the same, I would say for the price, and the convenience of these, not to mention their waterproof abilities, are well worth a shot. I wear them daily while paddling my Bellyak and have had them for only about a month or so, but would highly recommend these."
5	:	"Really enjoy these headphones. The sound quality is better than expected, but most of all love the fit! Comes with a bunch of different options to fit your ear. They stay in place very well and are comfortable. Perfect for working out."
5	:	"Easy to set up, great sound for music and phone use. You don't get the feeling of loosing out too much of the bass on music. Noice cancellation is great. I highly recommend. I have these and another brand that I switch using depending on what I'm doing."
1	:	More so for people with big ears not trying to offend anyone. I am a women and i have small ears. So these earphones did not fit me comfortable at all. I just received these yesterday  and was so EXCITED and i tried all the earpieces to make sure of perfect fit but no that didn't fit the ear hook would not fit right MY EARS ARE SMALL AND NO THEY ARE NOT DEFORMED i just think they were made for people with large ears and again not saying with disrespect only just won't fit anyone with small ears. So money wasted. But i will stay  sounds great another thing i notice and maybe on my Samsung S8 leaving the room with earphone in connection goes in and out so the up to 33ft was crap i was in my living room phone was close in my bedroom but maybe range differ on different phones
5	:	Really easy to pair with my fitbit ionic.  Sound is amazing.  Really surprised so far.  Haven't had a chance to use them in a workout yet but am interested to see how they work.
2	:	The first 10 days these were perfect. Then they began dropping out. Cutting out and losing signal.  Yes they were fully charged. They just did not work as well as they should and it is terrible frustrating when you lose your music in the middle of your activity.  Ihave them ( had ) thwm paired to an Iphone 6.  Now they are paired with my junk drawer
5	:	Great product great sound quality and stays on and in your ear well while being very active.i would recommend to anyone active or none active
5	:	I was skeptical about these headphones but I purchased them anyway to see how they sound. I must say these headphones are comfortable and have great sound quality. Even has a case for them when traveling. The noise cancellation work better than any other headphones I've purchase in the past. I should have bought two of these.I love the headphones. Thank you SoundWhiz.
5	:	"These headphones are great! I run and workout at the gym with them and they do not slip out like others i've had. The sound quality is top notch - and the noise canceling aspect works great. Was hesitant to buy these bc of the price and i thought they might be cheap, but i am extremely impressed and would definitely buy again."
5	:	"There are better sounding headphones out there, but these are wireless, well-priced, easy to use and convenient. But when I say there are better sounding headphones out there just know that I've spent $350 on headphones before so I'm a bit of a hobbyist. They hold charge well whenever I remember to plug them in between uses. Only ever had the battery run out when I forgot to charge it. One complaint I do have is that the automated voice thing reminding you that the battery is low is, in my opinion, significantly louder than your music so the notification startles me every time I get it. Perhaps turning up the volume on your phone and down on the headphones prevents that (the volume controls are separate from the phone volume at least on my android galaxy S7). Also I have a Fitbit Blaze and it connects to my phone via Bluetooth as well and offers music control, but since these are also Bluetooth they don't work together or something? I can't use the Blaze to skip songs or change the volume when I use these, however there are features on these for both of those on these headphones so it doesn't really matter. Just thought I'd throw that out there in case anyone wanted to know for some reason. Also it comes with extra earbud tips of different sizes and some memory foam ones so that's nice."
2	:	"Pretty disappointed in these. I was looking for running earphones that supported Apt-X. This page specifically says they support that codec, but in practice, they do not. They default to SBC (standard codec), which means your bluetooth music quality is still meh.These earphones are okay, but when you buy them because they specifically list a certain feature, you expect to get that feature. I got a different product than what's actually listed on the page."
4	:	"They're a little loud with my phone and they fall off if you only have one bud in at a time, but they fit great, have great sound quality, and sync with a wide variety of my devices. As long as I have both ears in they fit very well without any problems. I think they are a very affordable, versatile bluetooth headphone set."
4	:	"This seems to be a good product.  I have a home cell phone and a work cell phone, and was able to pair both devices by following the directions.  Sound quality seems great to me. I just purchased this product, and look forward to using it for a long time."
5	:	"I???m pleased with these earbuds for listening. They work very well for my music and podcasts. Comfortable and great battery life. Also, the customer service is outstanding.  My wife does not like talking to me on the phone with these on, but the calls are perfect on my end. This is a great product for my use, and I would recommend them to someone looking for wireless earbuds in this price. range."
5	:	"Amazingly Great Bluetooth Headphones...Especially for the price!I've tried several bluetooth headphones, and the Soundwhiz are better than many others costing as much as 4x more. I've had them for a little over a month. So far, no problems. They are very comfortable, pair easily, and have amazingly great sound!  In fact, they sound as good or better than many wired headphones.I have a career editing and mixing sound, so for me, sound quality is very important. These do not disappoint."
5	:	Initially the headphones worked very well for the first 2 months but then the battery became faulty.  Customer Service replied quickly and sent a replacement headphone within days!  Replacement headphones have worked very well for a couple weeks.  Very happy with headphones and quick customer support!
3	:	"The earphones stay in my ear very well using the large memory foam earplugs. The sound quality and battery life are good, and the product is simple and easy to use. This is my second pair, as the first stopped working after about a year when the right earphone stopped producing sound. I use these everyday running, and I'm hoping this pair will last a bit longer."
5	:	"I've used these earbuds for several weeks now, usually at the gym, running or doing yard work. I use them to listen to audio books, podcasts and taking phone calls and so far these are the best I've ever owned. I can't vouch for the musical aspect, but I would highly recommend due to the sound quality and long battery life. The cost ain't bad either."
5	:	"Just bought a second pair and I am just as happy with these as I am with the first pair.  These make great gifts!!!!  Highly recommend.I was worried about the sound and overall quality of this product based on the price.  However after having used this product for two days I'm very impressed!!  The sound is amazing ( nice deep bass) and so far they seem like they will be a long lasting product.  So far I'm very happy, I just hope they last!!!"
3	:	These are the first pair of Bluetooth ear buds ive owned. The sound quality is pretty good. I like that i can take phone calls but they are to big and arnt really good for running. Im not sure if its because i have small ears i still use them for listening to music but ill be shopping around for something different to run with.
5	:	"They arrived quickly, connected easily to my iPhone 7 and have been great on my bike rides.  No problems at all and they have good sound quality and fit my ears well with the multiple ear pieces provided.  Definitely recommend!"
5	:	"I like these headphones been using them for about 3 weeks. I LOVE the bass! I had bought 100 dollar ones that had weak bass. But these were cheaper and louder. About roughly 5 hour battery time. Noise cancelling is just too much if you plug them too your ear hole to far. You wont be able to even hear the music lol. I leave them about half way inside, the sounds better that way. And they wont fall out. For under 40 bucks im happy"
5	:	"Easy to pair, great sound, great feel in and on the ear.  I would definitely buy again and recommend."
5	:	Love these headphones.  They are perfect for running and walking. I???ve also used them while making phone calls and the sound was crystal clear. I did have a problem with the pairing after an update and I received quick response to my question and they even followed up to make sure everything was still good. I???d recommend these to anyone looking for wireless headphones!
4	:	Good item at a good price. Buds are light and hiooks work well enough to run w/. My daughter liked mine so much she got herself  a pair and really seems to enjoy them as well.
5	:	Great product. I purchased them to use with the Konecta for the gym. The fact that they are sweatproof and decent sound quality was the reason I wanted them. The ability to hear the TV while working out helps take my mind off of the fact that I am working out.
2	:	"This product works great for running.  Very comfortable.  However, as a microphone headset, it is very bad.  I need to remove the earpiece with the mic and put it next to my mouth for people to hear me.  The Bluetooth connection for the microphone also seems poor since I often had to reset the connection or it would randomly drop the connection with my phone and/or computer"
1	:	"I wanted to like these headphones; they were comfortable and had great sound. The only problem was, the right earphone didn't work. It occasionally would work for 3-5 seconds, but would immediately go out again. The search for good wireless headphones continues on!"
4	:	"I like these headphones a lot. They???re very comfortable and I use them running and lifting weights. The sound quality is good abd they???re easy to operate. I give the 4/5 only because my first pair stopped working, but their customer support was phenomenal, and they replaced them quickly, so I would highly recommend the company overall."
1	:	Wore for two days and the sound went to crap. Then the battery gave out. Worst purchase in a while.
5	:	Great product love them this is my second pair due to I lost my first pair. Will order again if I ever need to. Also they got great and feel good to wear
5	:	"Good product, great service. Works as expected, and for its price / warranty / service, cannot be beaten. Within a few weeks of receiving the headphones, I had a minor issue and asked the store if I could get a product replacement. Within a few days, no questions asked, I got a replacement piece, which works great.These fit pretty stably, and don't fall down during lifting (i've done oly weightlifting with these on)."
4	:	"I've only had my headphones for a few days, but I really like them so far. I appreciate the variety of ear bud pieces, and the memory foam is some thing new to me.Good bass.Only drawback is I wish they would give you an earlier warning about low battery. The warning came first at about 5 minutes left, then continued to sound about every minute until it died."
5	:	Great product. Able to listen to my music clearly at the gym even with terrible techno blasting in the background
5	:	Surprised at quality and battery life. Can???t believe I ever spent $180 on Beats. These are louder.
2	:	The headphones are extremely comfortable but I've had a lot of issues with the Bluetooth cutting out. At first you couldn't get four feet away. Soundwhiz contacted me with a solution (reinstalling the Bluetooth connection) which then worked perfect. The next time I used them I had to reinstall all over again. Each time I use them connection seems to get worse. Even with a full charge. I keep hoping it will get better as they are really comfortable. Perhaps I'll end up sending them back. Customer service has been great though.
4	:	"Arrived on time. Cute box for storage. Ear peice little big but that does not both my glasses, so win for me. Excellent sound. Easy to charge."
1	:	"I'm soooo so disappointed with these sounwhiz ear phone... it's not hiped up as they said it was, most of the time I have to repeat myself to the other person I'm speaking with and vice versa... had to get a replacement..."
5	:	"I've had a pair of these for a few months now. Good sound quality, with good bass if I get them far enough in my ears. Works great for phone calls as long as there isn't excessive background noise. Stays on my ear fairly well, even when running.My only gripe is that when the battery is running low, it will remind you of a low battery on a 60 second interval, rendering the headphones nearly useless. With that said, when the battery low warning is given, they only last for a few more minutes."
5	:	"So far I like these.  I have had to return three headsets from other companies because they have poor sound quality on phone calls.  These are clear on phone calls and music is clear as well.  The ear piece is soft and comfortable. I haven't worked out with them yet to see how they hold on while sweating.  I will update if there is a problem,"
2	:	"After a few months of use, the black loop that fits around the ear tore off with just normal wear and tear. I take care of things. The ear strap is very flimsy and a definite defect or weak point of this product. Other than that, they sound and work great."
4	:	"These headphones are great for the price. Fit is excellent. Noice cancelling is excellent. Pairing is easy. Instructions are straightforward. I gave it a 4 star because the sound quality isn???t great. My pair sounds a little muffled as if the bass is turned up too much. But still, well worth the price paid."
5	:	"Just got them, the sound is amazing and they sit well. For the time being the best I had so far when it comes to in ear Bluetooth headphones."
5	:	"These have worked very well for me! I have taken them on runs, or just around the house doing chores, and they are perfect for the job! I have paired them with both my phone and laptop, and it is a flawless transition between the two. They can work through walls up to a certain distance, and the battery life is a legit claim. Very pleased with these and how comfortable they are with the options of different buds. Absolutely no complaints!"
5	:	"Wow, these are very nice and not expensive.  Very simple to pair with android phone.  Like most of the reviews I read prior to purchase,  the foam ear pieces seem to work best. Great earbuds!"
5	:	"I've been using these headphones for months now, and I'm very satisfied with the exception that they don't stay on my ears (I have that problem with every type of headphone like this)."
5	:	Love these!  Great at eliminating surrounding sounds for studying and really pack a punch!
5	:	These are great!  I use them for working out and listening to the Bible.  They don't get caught on the weights or snag on anything.  They fit perfectly and sound excellent!
4	:	"couldnt find a bud adapter that didnt hurt my ear canal, but they have great connection by bluetooth and excellent sound quality."
4	:	Good cheap bluetooth. Only issue is monitoring the battery life. Its always completely off. Says battery low when the pic on the phone has half left. Sucks in the middle of a workout. But other than that they are great
1	:	"Nice design, worked well for first week.  Never accepted a charge again, completely dead now."
5	:	"Little wobbly, but I really like these.  The bass is phenomenal and unexpectedly good.  It gets pretty loud too, loud enough for me and sound as good as an over the ear jbl set that I just got.  The bass actually makes my ears vibrate, kinda cool. I use these for running and actual used a previous soundwhiz model before for about a year.  These are sweatproof and sound better and are more comfortable.  Definitely the best pair of like headsets ive ever had and ive had several."
5	:	The headphones are awesome. I was sold on the 1 year general warranty as well as the lifetime sweat warranty after trying another brand and going through 6 pair in the last 18 months. The foam earbud adapters are a genius idea as it allows the headphones to fit and filter outside noise just like foam ear plugs. The volume levels are perfect as the lowest setting is enough for relaxed listening and I also have lots of volume for when I hit the gym. Thanks.
5	:	"I just got these are they are pretty nice. They linked up with phone quickly, siri works great and the feel good. They have crazy good bass too, I might have to turn my music down."
5	:	These are some of the best sounding bluetooth earbuds I have ever tried. I did have an issue with the first set after about 5 months of solid use.  They were replaced immediately through their excellent customer service. This product is well worth the price!!
1	:	"Unfortunately the sound is horrible. This sucks because they are actually really comfortable and don't fall out my ears. The sound almost seems muffled. They are way too bassy, but not in a good way. The bass isn't even accurate."
4	:	I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and sound quality of these headphones.  They do not fall out of my ears like other Bluetooth earbuds.
5	:	"I've used this for over a week and so far I am pretty happy. Great sound quality, battery seems to be good so far, and syncing this to my iphone was flawless. I would recommend this if you're looking for a good pair of budget wireless bluetooth headphones."
5	:	"GREAT headphones! They pair up super fast, easy to use - very intuitive. Great product!"
5	:	Great headphones but they suddenly quit working but the company promptly sent a new pair and I have had no problems with them.I will be ordering from this company again.
5	:	"If you run or do any type of workout then these things are perfect. Amazingly comfortable and great sound quality. Hard case, foam and silicone ear pieces. Soft ear hooks, light and all the hands free features you want for your phone. I had a pair of beats powerbeats2 and they lasted about a month before problems started and in 3 months wouldn't turn on anymore. Just did a 3 mile run in these new ones and I have to say they blow the beats away in comfort and design. So far I'm more than impressed with the design, functions, sound and comfort."
4	:	Light weight and comfortable.  Easy to pair and fast.  Clear sound.  Ear buds are snug and stays in.  Wore for hours and ears do not hurt.
1	:	"Of course, 2 days after the return period ended the headphones stopped taking a charge.  They are comfortable and the sound is good enough. However, the integrity of the charger chord connection is very poor and lasted just long enough to avoid my ability to return it."
5	:	"I was surprised at the quality of these headphone, it works seamlessly with my iPhone, music BUMPS and calls are crystal clear on both ends. So far the battery life of these headphones have been OUTSTANDING. I would highly recommend these! You honestly can't beat them for the price."
1	:	"I was running and the earbuds just quit working.  I thought perhaps the battery had not charged.  I hooked them up to a charger, and they still will not come on."
2	:	"I bought this product based on the description of them being water and sweat proof and while the worked initially, they stopped charging after 5months.The other thing is that the wrap around for your ears are useless; you must rely on the ear piece to fit and hold in your ear.I bought a warranty plan from Assurant and had to ask for a claim, I will not buy these again."
5	:	Love the color of these and I finally figured out how to get them to fit snuggly in my ears. And great sound quality!
5	:	Excellent product.  Comes with a full assortment of ear inserts of varying types.Sound is excellent and bluetooth connection is easy and reliable.
5	:	"Sound and clarity is very good and the battery life is excellent. Controls are well situated on top of right side. Comfortable and stay in place while working out, you will not be disappointed. Also, extra long chord connects both ear buds which is a plus when working out."
5	:	These are great. They come with a selection of different sized ear buds to ensure proper fitting / noise cancelling. I have done many different types of cardio workouts and these remain securely in my ear.
5	:	"I no longer need to worry about spending $150+ for an excellent pair of Bluetooth earbuds.  In fact, I've bought a pair for each of my nephew's and nieces for the holiday!  I wear these at the gym, while doing yardwork, on the airplane (actually noise cancelled the crying baby a few rows back!).  Good purchase.  I would highly recommend."
5	:	I have not taken these off since I got them. They are even comfortable enough to sleep in. I rely on sound stimulation in order to focus at work and help me fall asleep. I love them!
5	:	This waterproof bluetooth had the easiest setup and warranty registration I have ever seen.  The controls are intuitive and the instruction book that came with the headphones made it easy to figure out all of the settings.  Looking forward to trying this out in the gym tomorrow.
4	:	Works well. My only complaint is that it's way to bass heavy. Its great for talking.
4	:	"Really good set but it will have times where the bluetooth will cut out or get very choppy. Im not sure if its from interference yet, but im hoping to find out soon."
5	:	"Awesome headphones - great sound, love the memory foam ear buds, and the carrying case.  You don't need anything else - this is awesome sound for the price."
5	:	Fantastic sound quality and connects well to my Pixel 2. Stays on my ears fine. Need to be swiped into your phone in order to use Google Assistant.
5	:	"I really love how easy this product is to manage.  The wireless headphones fits my ear perfectly.  It stays on strong as I run, and the music does not skip.  I also like that the battery life is very long.  Everything about this product is excellent, and made perfectly."
1	:	"Relied on all the positive reviews and was disappointed. You get what you pay for. Bad sound quality, cheaply made, no noise cancelling, left ear doesn???t stay on properly. If you???re used to higher quality, then pay more for a reliable brand. I???ll be returning these and getting something better. Customer service is good but there???s not much people can do for you when the product is just low quality."
5	:	"The sound is excellent. They are extremely comfortable on the ears. I would definitely buy them again. The only complaint that I have is that the low battery notification is within five minutes of the headphones shutting down. I wish there would be some way we could find out much sooner that we are running out of juice. Otherwise, well worth the price!"
1	:	These hurt my ears after having them in for 10 minutes. Really bad. And I couldn???t get them to stay on. I would return them if my son didn???t rip the box.
5	:	I love the comfort and ease of use with these headphones. They stay in place and the sound is great! Bluetooth pairing is simple and easy to do. The company is very customer satisfaction oriented. I especially liked the video that they sent showing proper fit of the earbuds.
3	:	Pretty solid headphones for only 30 bucks. The sound quality isn't the best and doesn't work very well for hands free calls but they are probably the most comfortable headphones I've had.
5	:	Sound quality and fit are great! Stays on my ears even while running!
2	:	They never want to connect to my phone! Total waste of money!
1	:	Headphones no longer charge after 1 week of use
5	:	"Really great for the price.  Took a while before I found the size I liked.  Thankfully, they give you several from which to choose.  Volume is great, connection is easy & consistent."
5	:	These earbuds are comfortable and they have a great sound.
3	:	easy to connect to iphone.  nice case it came in.  not impressed with the sound at all
4	:	I just received these today. They are now charging so I havent been able to pair with my phone yet. It came with several ear sizes to assure a good fit. I would like to send another review after I used them.
4	:	They stay in place and block the sound while you have them on.Only down part for me is that the part that goes over the ears is a little big for my glasses to fit well.
4	:	"Had an issue with the first set (charging problem) and they immediately sent a replacement set. On the meantime, I liked them so much that I figured (hoped) it was an anomaly, and had ordered a pair for my son, and another back up pair for me! Highly recommend them. Ear fit is solid, bass is good, clarity excellent. I wish the battery life was longer, but who doesn't on every device they own?"
5	:	"Awesome headphones. I have another pair of SoundWhiz headphones, the older model, and bought these to have another pair for travel. I'm very impressed with the new Turbo model. The battery life is incredible and they are great for workouts as well as phone calls. Highly recommended!"
5	:	I had powerbeats 2 and I can very confidently tell you that these are very durable. Don't look for good audio quality in gym headphones because you WILL NOT notice it after 10 mins.
5	:	"Previously had a pair of taotronics....these are far surperior I think...the sound is great , ease of use, the many options to custom fit the ear buds. Can't go wrong. Would highly recommend!"
4	:	"Great product, was easy to set up and the bass and sound quality is really solid. I usually can't wear these kinds of earbuds and had trouble getting them to stay at first, but once I got used to them they fit very comfortably. Works well for workouts involving lifting and weights; might need to take more time to get used to them while running but so far am very pleased with them."
5	:	Best headphones I've ever owned!
5	:	Is it by far the best headphones I've ever bought. Easy use voice quality is very good on phone calls. The noise cancellation works very very well. My girlfriend says they work too well in her opinion. If you're comparing these against something else go with these. I run a small construction company and I'm constantly active while working and I have no issue with these headphones moving nor do I find any inconvenience in wearing them
5	:	Very comfortable design.  Great case and a good quantity of changeable earplug types to choose from.
4	:	Good sound. Slightly above average bass than most in ear headphones. Comfortable earpiece. Easy Bluetooth connection and operation.
2	:	These no longer work. My window of opportunity to return has expired. Please let me know what I can do
5	:	First Bluetooth headphones for me and these were great.  Easy to set up and great for listening.  Kept an airplane ride nice and quiet.
4	:	"I actually received a phone call from Soundwhiz and spoke with a very nice lady who really wanted to hear some suggestions about their product.  I make it a point to reach out to the company first before leaving my feedback.  They are very interested in improving the ""over the ear"" and the ""in ear"" models.1. The power button is right where you have to press to push the earpiece into your ear or readjust it.  I would change the power connector and the power button and put each where the other is or move it to the front of the side piece so that it is still in a predominant area but not where you push to get it to fit in your ear where you want it.2. The over the ear holders basically don't do much because they don't bend to shape and don't sit against your head as they stick outward a bit before curving back and around the ear.3. I realize that these are directed towards those who run , however, the treble needs to be improved a lot.For those that can adjust the EQ on their devices I would suggest using the ""bass reducer"" (I own an iPhone) to get more of a good overall sound quality.  The highs are muffled a bit too much for me and I have used different in ear covers just to see if that was part of the problem.4. I do like the soft memory foam ear covers though.5. The rubber covered wire that connects the two ear pieces is very memory retaining and won't lay comfortably against the neck.Other than the nuances above I do think the sound is really good but if you want really great sound go ahead and spend 300 bucks on a Bose or Beats by Dre unit. You cannot beat the sound from these at this price.  I would have paid over 70 for these."
4	:	"So far these are working pretty well for me. I need to use them a bit more before and figure out a few quirks.  Namely, issues with the microphone while taking phone calls. I've had the person on the phone say I sound either robotic or like I'm in a tin can. Otherwise, works well as wireless headphones. It would also be helpful if the part that sat inside the ear were just a bit smaller."
5	:	I have gone through a few Powerbeats3 wireless headsets which all stopped working due to moisture which is frustrating as I spend a lot of time running and listening to my music. So far the SoundWhiz Turbo headphones are operating as advertised with no problem whatsoever. I really like them. Great product. Thanks
4	:	"Functional, pretty good sound quality. Sometimes the volume sounds uneven between the ears."
5	:	loved their tech support after 6 PM  - usually they never have a tech support after US timezonesthe support was excellent
5	:	"As a consumer it's always great to come across a company that seems to honestly care about producing a good product and service.  In both aspects SoundWhiz is remarkable.  The headphones are incredibly comfortable and cancel out virtually all noise.  Their service was even better, taking the time to reach out, making sure I understood how to use the product and how to register for the warranty.  Highly recommend these!"
3	:	"I have tried all of the ear pieces and they just don't stay in place, especially when I start sweating. I did a 10k and halfway through, they slid right off my ears and I had to carry them the rest of the way. The battery life is great and sound is great, they just don't fit well."
5	:	"These headphones are great!The first pair from another company that I ordered did not have enough bass for my taste.I returned them as soon as I heard these SoundWhiz phones.Good bass,just what I was looking for!!!"
5	:	Absolutely love these headphones I bought in four pairs for the price they just can't be beat!
5	:	"Love these! Awesome for running. They are not slipping out of your ears. Comfortable with glasses too, yes!The snug fit blocks out background noise. Great for when you don't to hear whining!"
5	:	Works great I have small ears so it's hard to find ear buds that stay in my ear.  The memory foam ear buds are great stay put and block out a lot of noise.  Great for running and working out
5	:	Awesome Product as well as the service highly recommended.
5	:	"These are great headphones. Setup is a snap and the variety of plug sizes provided ensures that you'll be able to find a good fit. I use them when mowing the lawn and the only problem I have is being careful not to sing along with the music that no one else can hear. Eh, the neighbors think I'm nuts anyway."
5	:	"Stable connection with my s7 active, long range Bluetooth if I set my phone down,  and they are reliably sweat proof and sauna proof. Not to mention they are durable, easy to use and comfortable. Price wise these are very good, the only con being some very light distortion"
5	:	"Great pair of headphones. I do Muay Thai, weightlifting, and I like to go running. this pair of headphones are amazing. They hold well to your ear and do not fall of. Additionally, they sound great, one of the best headphones I ever had. This is defendetly the best purchase i have done on amazon. I highly recommend them.They make you look amazing and they are great for sports. The battery also last for a long time and thy charge pretty fast. I am very happy with this purchase."
5	:	"These headphones have been great! I???ve bought numerous ones about the same price before but these have been the best! I do wish the part that wraps around your ear was more sturdy, just so it could be a more secure fit, and these are a little bulky. I definitely like the sweatproof aspect of these! Overall, I???m very satisfied with my purchase!"
1	:	Disappointing - item will not charge out of the box
5	:	"Simple to use, great sound, good for without hall the things that make wireless earbuds off balance and irritating.  Terrific battery life. Comes with a very handy case and several additional in ear fit options to meet every users need. Excellent product!"
5	:	"Have been using these headsets for a while.  The bluetooth connection seems a little weak sometimes (the receiver is on your right ear so you have to keep your phone in your right pocket, or right side) but other than that the sound quality is great and the batter power is great!  I was pleasantly surprised with their great customer service as well, will be ordering from them again!"
3	:	Not great for running. Pretty flimsy. Good sound quality for otherwise general use. A little disappointed though bc I had to order a different pair since my primary use was for running.
5	:	"They have amazing sound. I have only had them for a few days, but have been better so far than my power beat 2s. They are much louder and once you get use to the rubbery ear hooks, these headphones are a wonderful(and reasonably priced) addition to a workout. The carrying case is also pretty solid although a little bulky and the charge time of the headphones is decent. Sometimes people can't hear me when I'm on the phone, but other than that a great pair."
5	:	"Love these, haven???t tried them on an airplane yet, but so far so good"
4	:	"I like these and think they are a great value for what you get. My only complaint is that in the Louisiana heat, when I get sweaty during a jog, they seem to start popping out of my ears."
5	:	"Very happy with this purchase, I even bought another one for my bf. He loved it too! Fast delivery!!!"
5	:	"I love these wireless headphones!  Once you get them to fit snugly (I've had a very difficult time finding a set that fits properly), they don't come out at all while running/lifting and the sound is fantastic!  You can't beat the price and I am very happy with my purchase!"
5	:	The ear plugs are great and the sound is perfect.  Very easy and comfortable to use.
5	:	"I used to have a pair of beats wireless 2 and they broke multiple times until the warranty ran out. I was tired of super expensive blue tooth head phones that I could use for work outs. I found these sound whiz headphones and the price was right and I'm very pleased with them. They set up quickly, have decent battery life, great sound and are comfortable. Great band for the buck!"
5	:	"Use them at the gym.  Good sound.  Seem rugged, so far. Convenient"
4	:	"I really love the headphones. They were easy to setup and register the warranty. I gave the headphones 4 stars because they are not steady when in the ear. That maybe because I'm not using the right size, even though I've tried each size. Overall, I love the sound, the style, and the price was excellent. Thank you for a great product."
1	:	"They are terrible for anyone who sweats, would not stay in my ears and the hooks on top could never stay in place. Was miserable the entire time I ran with them. Having to readjust them every couple of minutes. Couldn???t change songs and would randomly call people in my phone."
5	:	This seems like a great device in general. However even the smallest earbuds are too big for my ears. I may have to return this.Update: I wrote to their customer service and they were incredibly helpful and responsive!! They sent me a few other types of earbuds to try and I'm very happy to be able to keep the now. Sound quality is so great. Thank you!
5	:	"Work great! Wonderful for plane rides, exercise, or cleaning around the house. Love the built in controls in the headset."
1	:	Won't take a charge won't turn on two weeks I had it
5	:	..beyond my wildest expectation . Great deal!
5	:	Awesome headphones and amazing customer service!!!I just bought one after my husband who???s been using it for months raved about it so much ????
5	:	I absolutely LOVE my earbuds! I had a problem with them after a few glorious days of great music. The customer service was crazy good! I had new earbuds within 2 weeks and I always felt like my order was important and not just waved off. I am a true believer in these earbuds and will continue to use these until I never listen to music again (haha never). Thank you for making such a great product!
5	:	Very happy with these. Battery is good for about a week and I use them for about an hour a day. They???re comfortable and easy. Recommend
5	:	Great quality sound.. ear loop is a bit too big but all & all great ear buds & 6+ hours of power life.
4	:	"Overall this is a nice set of earbuds, leaves a bit to be desired in terms of sound quality which is why I give it only 4 stars. I do like the ability to connect it to more than one device, that's a nice feature."
5	:	"I have been looking for a wireless headset for a while, but reviews have always been mixed.  Then I found SoundWhiz. The reviews seemed worthy of a try and I was not disappointed. The headset paired easily and I was off and running. The music quality is great and the headset is comfortable.  Very happy to be wire free. The customer service is excellent.  Nice to have a company that stands behind their product. Looking forward to running many miles with my new headset."
5	:	Best earbuds I ever bought!1. Clarity was excellent2. Bass was tight3. Stayed in my ear during extensive movement4. Easily paired with my phoneThe next pair I buy will definitely be SoundWhiz!
5	:	I have never had a blue tooth device. This is my first one. I absolutely love them and they sound great!!! Easy to set up
5	:	"Worked perfectly right out of the box. Wears comfortably. Has a good selection of earbuds, both foam and silicone. Sound quality is an improvement from the over-the-ears headphones I had been using."
5	:	works great so far.  A little too much bass when using a foam eartip but I am satisfied.
5	:	"Great product.  Better than my broken $200 Beats wireless!Lightweight, comfortable fit and feel"
5	:	"After several cheap wireless headphones that don't work, finally I LOVE this SoundWhiz set of Bluetooth wireless headphones!  They are extremely easy to use, extremely clear, just overall great headphones."
5	:	"I was a little skeptical at first but decided to take a chance, was I ever blown away, these things sound amazing, way better than those $100+ ones, the sound was crystal clear and the base was nice and deep, and they're so comfortable it feels as if you don't have anything on at all, I am very very satisfied and glad that I took a chance with these"
5	:	"These are super comfortable. However, they stopped pairing with our phones after an ios update. Contacted Soundwhiz, they were very responsive and gave me detailed instructions on how to unpair and reset the earbuds. Worked like a charm! Kudos to Soundwhiz for awesome customer service."
5	:	"The optional memory foam earbuds are comfortable, help to seal out background noise and fit securely while running. The only negative is that one of the plastic pieces on the right earpiece makes a distracting rattling noise while running. Quality sound, easy to use, convenient features. Great product overall!"
5	:	"The sound is great, sweat proof, they are not so comfortable when you run, you have to accommodate them all the time if you do extreme exercise, but the earphones promise many things, as it is published in the description. Excellent material quality and sound quality ."
5	:	"I love these. I was eyeing the Bose ones for quite some time but couldn't force myself to pay like $140. I've had these for like 2 months and love them. I don't know what they are like in comparison, but for them to be my best wireless set I'd say it's a definite win."
5	:	"I owned the last model of Soundwhiz headphones and I was very satisfied, so when I lost them I bought the Soundwhiz Turbo. Hands down the best headphones I have ever owned. The bass is five-star. I never could say that before about a Bluetooth headset, which is usually flat."
5	:	"I had an older model of these headphones and the top ear part fell off on the left ear. I emailed the customer service representative and they shipped me brand new headphones for free in 3 days. I'm amazed by their customer service. The headphones are fantastic, mainly because they stay in my ear when I'm working out. I've owned beats wireless headphones and these are just as good for about 1/5 of the price. Paying for beats instead of just buying these would be like paying for a logo on a polo shirt."
5	:	"My previous wireless set only ran for around 4 hours, these ran over twice the time and have much better sound.  More detailed and better low frequency, great for watching action flicks on my computer.Good price for high quality."
5	:	"Love these!! I've had 2 pairs of Beats PowerBeats and both were garbage. I decided to return those and get these...look the same, never fail and way cheaper. I have already recommended these to other people as they are WAY more reliable than the other bluetooth headphones I've bought. Never fall off when running or during a hard workout."
3	:	"Decent pair of headphones, my one big complaint is the lack of middle to upper register. The bass in the headphones is great, however it muddies the upper range making it harder to hear things like people talking in videos. For music it is okay, however the bass is overwhelming. Still a good steal for the price. No problems with the Bluetooth pairing, very easy to pair."
5	:	I bought several pairs of Bluetooth headphones and these are by far the best in sound and comfort.
5	:	"Best headphones you'll ever use.  Crisp, and clear sounds. I like the idea of the different sizes of ear buds and the extra soft foam-like one as a bonus."
5	:	"Sounds great, and easy to pair.  Holding up/down buttons doesn't seem to navigate tracks (Samsung S6/Spotify), but not a big deal, and I probably need to read the manual anyway."
5	:	Great sound and good battery. Very happy with this product.
5	:	"Seems like they are a great company that takes care of it's customers! So far, so good! My husband says they are very comfortable around his ears, especially with his eyeglasses on. Warranty is amazing and customer service seems top notch!"
5	:	"These are outstanding. I have a ""beat"" wireless headphone that cost $199. These are just as good with better fit and more user friendly controls."
5	:	So far awesome quality and no slipping!  I've run over an hour and a half and no slippage!  Easy to use too.
5	:	Love love love!  I tried them out just the other day and the sound is great and super cool that I can answer my calls on it.  Looking forward to using them at the gym.  I also love that they're wireless so I don't have to worry about my destroying my phone like I've done in the past.
4	:	Still fall out of my ears but better quality than most.
3	:	Item arrived on time & with all items & instructions to get started listening to my favorite tunes. Volume is great...I have to use the lowest volume though & the smallest earbuds. The over the ear device is a bit flimsy.
5	:	What a great surprise! I used it on my 9 hour flight and lasted for 8 hours nonstop!  Love it. I order another one for my husband!
5	:	I use these every day and they are VERY comfortable and VERY loud and very easy to use.
4	:	Works good. I used it for 3 weeks. The pros: Never dropped connection with my iPhone. Good battery life. I used them all day while listening to podcasts. The cons: they are big for in ear headsets and I personally did not like having the cord behind my neck as it occasional pulled on my ears when my computer bag would catch the cord.
5	:	easy to use. Great tone and reception. The listener on the other end says the calls are clearer. I like this product.
3	:	"Do not try and swim with this item, other then that works great!!!!"
5	:	"Bought these for my husband to use when practicing / playing golf....they are still under the tree, but I tried them out with his iPod and I was impressed with the sound. The set up was easy and the reps from the company have checked in via email to be sure I was not having any issues.Will update the review once he has a chance to use them....."
5	:	"Great product! Had them for several months. I have been running with them quite a bit. They are very loud, have great sound and have excellent battery life. Sweat and light rain have been no problem. Highly recommend!"
4	:	Fit good nice sound good price all in all nice purchase
5	:	"Great sound! Comfortable to wear, easy to pair. In short, I???m pretty sure these are the best I???ve owned."
4	:	"Delivery service was as stated however it did not come with everything shown in the ad. The ad shows that a carrying case and I assumed that a charger and cable would also be included. When I opened the box the only thing in the box was the head set..NO charger, case or cables. If seller reads this I would appreciate a complete order"
5	:	"So I wasn???t happy about these dying after 4 months and let it show. However, the response from the company was a swift and positive experience. I have had problems with other products and been told too bad so sad, so a responsive seller is more important than a product issue."
1	:	It stopped working after the 1st day
5	:	Bought as a gift. My brother says they are fantastic!
4	:	"Works well, my only issue is while walking if the phone is in my back left pocket it loses signal to the head set. If I hold the phone or have it in a pocket on my right side it works well. Has great sound and noise reduction. I use it while on the riding mower and I can hear the music or phone very well while the mower is running! Highly recommend this to anyone wanting to go wireless!"
5	:	The quality of the ear buds seems exceptional.  They are very easy to use.  Good erometrics.  Sound quality is excellent.  Hope the re-charging battery holds up over a long period.  I'd recommend the product and would buy it again.
1	:	"Purchased these headphones only 9 months ago and they no longer stay connected unless my phone is in my hand, not pants pocket or running belt. Disappointing.  The first 6 months they were great but can no longer run with headphones."
1	:	Kinda bulky.
5	:	Great sound & comfortable to wear.  These work great!
4	:	Very happy with the quality and sound. I do wish there was a way to skip to next song by simply clicking a button on the headphones but that's not a feature.
4	:	"I like the sound of this headphones, they are very comfortable when I am trying or running, Only I would like the battery to last a little longer when it is already at 10% you hear a voice that indicates that the battery is low very frequently and is a bit annoying if you are focused on the music"
5	:	Great headphones for the price point. Spot on customer service.
4	:	Great earphones for working out in only downside is the angle which they fit in can get a little uncomfortable.
5	:	The speakers are great. I use them for running and I can barely feel them and they stay on. The sound quality is good they are no bose but again you are not paying a Bose prices. Will definitely recommend them.
3	:	It is just OK.  Does not have good connection pass 10-11 feet.
5	:	Extremely pleased with ease of use and performance. Also very comfortable
4	:	"Bought these a month ago and so far they are great the only con I have is , the rubber around the ear seems to be a little weak but besides that they work great"
5	:	These are great. Given the price I will buy them as gifts and will recommend them to anyone looking for workout headphones.
5	:	"Great sound - deep bass, clear lyrics with music.  Distinct voices with audiobooks.  Easy to use, comfortable to wear.  Have not had to use customer service but I appreciate the initial contacts."
4	:	easy to use and setup. great voice quality. love it.
2	:	Used these 5 times and they're already shorting out whenever I move. Can only use them if I sit still. May return.
5	:	"In my opinion, the sound quality of the SoundWhiz Turbo Earbuds is better than some higher cost brand name ear buds that I have tried.  The bass sound is very good for an earbud style headphone, and so is the battery life between recharges."
5	:	"Hadnt purchased over the ear headphones on previous items cuae i was sure they would be uncomfortable. This product proved me wrong. very comfortable, lightweight, and doesnt move around. also, one of the few product i found that offers xs earbuds, and the memory foam options."
5	:	Love them.Thought they would bother me. I wear glasses. Not at all.
5	:	These earbuds are wonderful.  They are the first earbuds that I have purchased that stay in my ear.  I also like how they are very comfortable and have great sound.
1	:	these didn't last long at all.  mines died!!
5	:	"Love them! Great sound, fairly comfortable fit, stays in place."
4	:	"Connects/disconnects very easily and fits snugly, but the sound quality is mediocre (crackly at times, and definitely don't get a deep sound). The mic works surprisingly well. Somehow mine are also loud, but there's probably a setting on my phone that I can adjust for that."
5	:	Took a minute to get the earpieces just right-but am loving them so far!  Great sound and super easy to pair with my devices.
5	:	To be honest I can say that these headsets are great ...battery last long ...sweat proof and I mean I swear like crazy in the gym ..the sound for the price are awesome...u womt be let down. ...
5	:	"I bought these for my husband. He's active and can't ever find ear phones that stay in his ears comfortably. He loves these. They stay in, are comfy, have great sound and good battery life!"
2	:	"I really enjoyed these headphones when I first received them, but I had an issue with the battery needing to be recharged often, and then they completely died on me less than 3 months after receiving them, so now they are trash. I would not buy these again."
5	:	Came in on time and  they sound awesome. very comfortable. I own  a farm I use them all the time no problem very durable.
4	:	"Bought them and was pleasantly surprised,They sound great even paired against higher priced sets, they are very comfortable(at least for me) , i use them for working out and cycling.They charge quick and last  almost as advertised."
5	:	Use these every day at the gym. They are amazing at canceling out the noise of the gym.
5	:	"They arrive charged so you can use them immediately. Smart. Nice case, seems pretty sturdy. The sound is good, as good as my Phiaton BT 220s and much more convenient for working out. Very comfortable. Easy to pair. The floppy rubber ear guides do help keep the buds in place."
5	:	arrived very quickly. high quality for the price. easy to understand instructions
5	:	"works well as expected, compfortable"
5	:	I love my sound whiz wireless headphones. They are great for work and exercising and the customer service is Excellent. Will purchase again as a gift.
5	:	I love these and they sound pretty good for the price. I say it has the same sound quality as my apple headphones that came with my iPhone. I use these a lot of they're holding up pretty good.
5	:	Great sound!!!  I bought a second pair immediately !!!  Nose has nothing on SoundShiz products!!  I exercise with no problem with my headphones..
4	:	"Only thing I wish was different, was if the ear pieces that go around your actual ear to help hold it in place was a harder plastic and not so flimsy. If the inner ear piece were to come out of your ear, it is not strong enough to hold the ear bud onto your ear. Outside of that, I think the product works great."
5	:	"I just bought these and I love them so far. I was needing a set of Bluetooth headphones that had the hook for my ears so they didnt fall out and these do just the trick. Very easy to use and it comes with a cute little carrying case and PLENTY extra of those little rubber ear bud pieces. For the price, it's SO worth it!"
5	:	perfect
4	:	ProsGreat FitEasy to connectclear instructionsgood audio qualityConswhen I'm riding  bike sometimes the audio gets dropped for few secsQuality of the travelling case is not great.. I can already see the thread holding the case coming apart
5	:	These are very comfortable for small earsSound is great.
2	:	"They were fine for about a month, now they won't charge and I can't turn them back on.Also it is annoying when the battery runs low.  Every 30 seconds it stops music to say ""BATTERY LOW."" I'd rather they did that once, or just shut off when they were dead."
3	:	"I owned the previous model, and I bought this thinking it would be a upgrade. Turns out this product isn't for hardcore runners, as it bobbles in your ears a lot and falls out. It won't completely fall out, as the over-ear design. So it ends up just hanging there as you have to readjust it and place it back inside your ear. This doesn't happen so much while running, so it's bearable. BUT, if you play basketball or anything that you're jumping up and down these are terrible. Every possession down the court I am having to readjust them. They fall out so frequently. I can't understate how much of a pain this is. So deduct one star for this, and that's being generous as this is my main desire for headphones. To stay in my damn ear!Another cause for concern is the material for the wire that goes behind your head. It's comfortable at first. Same material feel as the over-the-ear plastic. But like that it's really flimsy. While the eras part doesn't prevent it from coming out of your ear, this does a better job as it doesn't bounce around much at all. Even at serious pacing it isn't annoying. I know, I said concern and there is one. Working out causes sweat and the strap sticks to sweat. It's a fantastic coating while you're dry but afterward it's very annoying to say the least. It doesn't shift back well to being centered and it takes your focus away, and you have to readjust as it sticks. This flaw makes you not want to swivel your head around at all. Very bad if you're shooting around in basketball or other sports.These bluetooth headphones are awful for sports, and aggressive activities. But they are great for casual runners, and at a gym for less intense exercises(not jump related). Another note, the charging cover is pretty loose in the revision. The old design was way better. Far more challenging to open up, but I thought that was a good thing to prevent sweat from leaking inside and it disallowed it from ever getting loose and causing friction with your skin. This is a very small gripe, but I want to mention everything.THE GOOD - They are comfortable and hold very good sound. Also the range of the bluetooth is solid. Though I do have occasional cuts in a full sized gym/basketball court with the paired device in the middle. However these cuts for me weren't anything to cause issue.Get these if you're not doing anything aggressive like basketball, where you sweat a lot, jump, and turn/make adjustments with your head frequently."
5	:	"Comfortable fit, it locks in my ear so when I'm at the gym they don't fall off, when I use it at work since I have them on for a longer period of time I use the softer ear tips and they are very comfortable, the sound is clear and it blocks outside noise."
4	:	"Paired easily with my iPhone; full charge lasts for over 5 hours; a little bulkier than I was expecting, but with the many different foam and rubber covers that came with it I was able to find a combination that stayed in my smallish ear canals..even during long trail runs and two marathons. Definitely well worth the price in my opinion"
5	:	"Excellent value for money. I was actually planning to buy Beats or Bose and ended up getting this after reading reviews and completely satisfied with the sound quality, ease of use and comfort."
5	:	"I got these for my husband and he loves them! He's all set and motivated to take on his New Year resolutions! The sound quality is great, and I'm so impressed that these are waterproof rated. Amazing product at a fraction of the price of other brands that aren't even waterproof! PLUS amazing and personal service that ensures you are satisfied with the purchase."
5	:	"Bought these after pouring over reviews - like, too many reviews, Amazon has so, so many generic Bluetooth earbuds - and even then, am surprised by how much I like these. Sound great, comfortable, no connection issues with my iPhone 7. I wouldn???t normally bother with registering for warranty, but they made it so easy - another bonus."
5	:	worked great then stopped  working after 8 monthsthey replced it right away great company
5	:	Great sound for the price. Light weight and don't fall out easily. Can get ~50ft from my phone before they cut out.
3	:	"Maybe it's just me but I cannot figure out how to connect these through Bluetooth. I have had many wireless headsets and never had a problem, but with these I just can't get it."
1	:	"At first, I loved my headphones. Then after the first charge, it would not recharge. I tried for days! Nothing. I give up and force a return."
5	:	Sound wonderful and are comfortable. Very good value for what you get. Next test duration.
5	:	I was skeptical about the quality based on the price. I'm a drummer and need a good practice pair of headphones that cut just enough noise that I can still hear what I'm doing...or take on a hike. They're perfect.
5	:	GREAT battery life and amazing rich sounds including an unexpected superior bass quality
4	:	"They sound quality is great and I don???t find them too bulky for my small ears and head. However, my power button rattles when I run. I am inquiring if all of them do this or if there is a problem with my head set. Hopefully I will hear back soon!"
4	:	"After sing m headphones only 5 times, they would not turn on or charge. i called the service number and the girl (who had an awesome Australian accent) registered my warranty and had a new pair issued in less than 10 minutes. 3 days later they were in my mailbox. Awesome service. Thank you."
5	:	These headphones have been awesome! They offer great sound quality for being wireless. They come with different options for the bud that actually fits in your ear so it is comfortable for you! The case that it comes in keeps everything together and organized. The battery charged quickly and held a charge well.
5	:	"I walk in the pool for exercise and needed something that wouldn't get destroyed if it got wet. I dropped these in the pool, and they still work great. I also tossed them to my bag, accidentally hit the wall behind the bag and they still work. I'm impressed!"
3	:	"I worked fine for a month or so, then it would not connect to my iPhone.  As instructed, I reset it to again receive a signal, and worked for 2 months.  Now it does not ""light"" up, no blue light, no flashing blue/red light, no audio response."
5	:	"My husband loves these. Very happy with this purchase. Great quality at an awesome price!! I may even buy a pair for myself. Also great company to buy from. Got an email to make sure my shipment arrived on schedule, and to help if we needed any troubleshooting to get the headphones connected to our phone."
5	:	Such an excellent purchase! The sound on these are so great and I cannot hear anything outside of the music when in my ears. They also never fall out of my ears when working out/running. I recommend them to people all the time!
5	:	I've had these for a week  and have been using the headset  sounds great stay put when running or exercise
5	:	"I really like this product! It's works really well, the sound quality is great, and it's fit's comfortably in my ears! This purchase was definitely worth the price and I recommend these to anyone looking for wireless headphones. Good job sound whiz! :)"
5	:	Great little wireless headset....sound is very good....easy to pair up to phone and mp3!
2	:	These headphones were great while they lasted. I used these headphones daily at the gym and work but after just four months they won???t charge or turn on. In the end you get what you pay for when it comes to these average sound quality and a pair not built to last.
5	:	"So far so good. They are easy to use, fit comfortably, intuitive, good sound, good noise canceling. Customer service obviously goes out of their way to make sure that you are satisfied and taken care of. Would recommend."
5	:	"These are FANTASTIC! Sound is great, fit is great. I am considering buying another pair! Well worth the price!"
4	:	"I loved this for a couple months. Then, they just stopped working. They won???t charge at all. I thought I???d have more than three months of use out of them. After the company saw this post, they gave me a refund AND a new pair! Incredible customer service!"
4	:	These may be the best headphones I've bought so far. They've already out performed my previous headphones. But keep in mind I've only had them about a week now. I'd say they're worth the money though.
5	:	"Love ""em delievered promptly pair effortlessly fit and sound very well and the mic that is used for making/recieving calls is better than expected this was my first pair of wireless head phones and a great choice!"
4	:	Didn't have high expectations but was pleasantly surpried.Sound quality:7/10 good bass and decent treble.Cons:Wire a little flimsy and the door for charge port won't stay closed.
5	:	Love these headphones!  The sound quality is great. They block out outside noise so you can really focus on your workout. They stay in place just like they are supposed to.
5	:	"The product is very new, the price is right, the use effect is beyond my imagination, I like it very much."
5	:	So far everything is great they stay in my ears while running and the sound is pretty good.
5	:	My husband loves these!  He said they work way better than the Beats he paid a lot more money for!!!!
5	:	"These headphones are fantastic! From the moment I got them, I received an email asking If i got them and if I had any questions from the company that makes them- very personal, it's great! They have fantastic bass (better than I anticipated!) and tops even some of my old bigger over ear headphones!"
4	:	So far so good! My main concern was for headphones to stay in my ears while running. What i love about this product is they come with 6 different ear bud fitting options (3 of 2 different types of material) These headphones are a good fit for anyone!
1	:	They are cute but did not fit and stay in my ears. I used all cushions provided and none fit. It is like the ear pieces are too heavy so they fall out. The design has flaws. Returned.
5	:	These are the best headphones i have ever gotten and recommend this to all u just have tk trythem to believe the sound and thw battery last for 9 hours plus
5	:	AmazingSo in love! I use them at the gym and outside walking and running! Great quality!!
5	:	"If you are a runner looking for head phones, these are really good for the price you pay! not so much bass, but it works good enough to get through your run/workout. I ran with it in the rain with no issues. Worth more than what the price is listed for...give er??? a go!"
5	:	"Love these, they are very comfy and sound is excellent"
5	:	These are great!  I got a set for everyone in the family.
5	:	"Great sound, way better than I expected. Used for workout/treadmill run and they stayed rock solid in place. Highly recommend for runners. The only problem is beware of ear tips, it is possible to block out too much outside noise."
3	:	"Arrived in a timely fashion, packaging is nice, they are well made and appear durable and easy to use. I like the zipper case. They're a bit dark and boomy for my taste. I'll continue my search for a nice crisp Bluetooth pair that suit my needs."
5	:	I had an issue with a defective pair but Soundwhiz reached out to me and replaced the pair for free and the headphones work excellently!! Fantastic sound quality and great bass for my taste
5	:	Super easy setup paring with my iPhone X.  Best Bluetooth earbuds I???ve ever had.u
5	:	"Wow, the noise cancelling is on point. Definitely a great investment."
5	:	Great product so far. Really does cancel out noise & is comfortable. There are different size ear buds which is very nice. Good sound.
5	:	"I love these earbuds. They last a very long time and are extremely durable. The sound quality is impeccable, especially for the price. Highly recommend. They never fall out of your ears while running, and they provide noise-cancelling music even at half volume."
5	:	"These earphones are comfortable, come with several accessories so that you can pick from a variety of ear bud sizes. Easy to install/connect to phone.  Best of all great sound quality! They stay one while running, doing box jumps, etc.  Make it easy to do laundry too with no cords in the way!"
2	:	Excellent quality and convenience...Until the headphones stopped working due to sweat and I didn't get my warranty in time. If you buy these make sure to register for the warranty or you'll be out of luck.
5	:	Great product!
5	:	"awesome product!! came quickly, easy to set up and use! would for sure buy from them again!!"
5	:	While only on Day 1 I really like these headphones especially for the price about a quarter of my last pair of Beats which I did not like. The fit and sound quality are both very good. I do need to play with the foam versus silicone to see which I prefer. The battery life and charging both are very good.
5	:	I love these SoundWhiz wireless headphones.  They work well with my iPhone 7 and stay in place when I???m active. I have had them for several weeks and I wear them 7-8 hours a day whether listening to music or Audible books. I would definitely recommend this product.
5	:	I have used these 5 days a week at gym for a year. great value for money
1	:	Right headphone doesn???t work.
5	:	I've been using these earphones consistently for the last month when working out and they stay in my ears great! No falling out like other brands I have tried. These are great headphones and I would definitely buy them again!
5	:	I love my SoundWiz wireless headphones.  I now have two pair so I have one available for the gym and one for running.  It is one of the best running related purchases I have ever made.  Just bought a pair for my son to use while skateboarding - he reports they work great.  The follow-up communication from the company has also been super.  Great company!!
5	:	Took a little bit to pair with my phone.. however once it was paired the sound is great! Can't wait to use them while I'm walking!
1	:	These are not waterproof. Bought them for floating and the left earbud went out. Now its the next day and the whole unit won't turn on. Another junk item sold on Amazon.
4	:	The sound is great on these earbuds with adequate  bass. They fit snugly and are a great bargain. Great experience so far.
2	:	Charge does not last more than an hour and the bluetooth connection is not great at all.
5	:	"This actually works perfectly fine for me on my Galaxy S6. Very easy to sync, connect, and use.I would say its a bit heavy on the low-end sound, but nothing worth complaining about for the price."
5	:	Headphones are awesome. Easily one of the best I've ever owned. First pair of wireless I've owned and was worried about how long they would stay charged. Other headphones researched might be smaller but only last a couple hours. I wanted something to use at work(construction) and these lasted no problem through a full 8hr day. Easy to pair with Bluetooth and easy to use buttons
5	:	"Easy to Sync with iPhone6s+; comfortable, with great sound quality.  When I had a glitch after 4 months of use, Customer Service was over-the-top responsive and helpful. They immediately honored the warranty."
5	:	These headphones in my opinion is better than the more expensive ones that I've owned in the past that kept breaking and not covered under warranty.  I highly recommend these.  Battery life is great I wear them my whole 8 hours at work streaming audio at a medium volume and the battery didn't die.
5	:	This has to be one of the best bluetooth headphones out there. I use it daily for gym. its completely noise cancelling and helps me listen to songs and videos in the middle of noisy gym and the sound quality is amazing. I highly recommend this product.
5	:	I love it
5	:	Bought these for a friend and WE love them! I can hear her way more clearly on the phone now!! Great BUY!
2	:	"Your design don't like but is good, also One day I just did not turn it on again, I've charged it for several hours, and it does not turn on, it does not work. Fuck product, a beep sounds twice and that's it"
5	:	Very comfortable fit and superior sound quality. I can listen all day on a single charge. Wide range of ear pieces will fit almost any ear easily.
5	:	Bought these headphones for my teenage son who really likes them. Had a issue with the battery charging after a few months but customer service was great and immediately sent us a new pair. My son prefers these over other headsets he's tried.
5	:	"I'm pretty impressed.  I have many BT headsets including plantronics, Samsung, Powerbeats 2 and I like these the best.  Good sound, good base and thus far has held up to sweat!  I'm a world class sweater and I have destroyed other and so far so good!  For the price and am extremely. Happy"
5	:	I love these headphones. They are great quality for the price. I haven???t had any issues so far when them. The sound is great and the battery life has been good so far. The seller has even been proactive following up asking if there were any problems but I haven???t had any. Great value.
4	:	"The device was easy to pair with my iPhone and sound quality is good.  The first time I used it the connection dropped, but several times since it has been fine.  Overall I am pleased."
5	:	"Comfortable, great sound and really a great value.  I am very happy with this purchase. I was not compensated for this review."
4	:	"So far I like the product. Thought I had a sound problem, but realized it was my phone settings that I have automated for driving. Once I changed the sound was great .  When talking on the phone, friends say they can clearly hear me."
5	:	"Very happy with the fit, sound, and ease of setup.  Everything I???ve seen so far tells me that Soundwhiz is shooting for great products and customer service."
3	:	"Charging has some problem. Mine stopped working after one month. However, the sound quality and customer service are good."
3	:	"These headphones are a good value. Nice volume and longevity. Sound tends to be a little muted because of the noise cancelling features but still good quality. I little bit of crackling every so often, nothing egregious."
4	:	Works fine but it is hard to keep in my ears.
5	:	"I use these primarily use these when paddleboarding. They fit great, the sound at times has a little  too much bass however the functions are very intuitive. I haven't fallen in the drink and therefore the true waterproofness and the security of the fit have yet to be tested. Overall they are exactly what I was looking for; a way to listen to music while I paddleboard."
5	:	Really good headphones for a very reasonable price. Best customer service ever to boot.
5	:	Headphones came exactly when they said they would. The sellers sent me a few emails about how to use the headphones which was very informative and much appreciated. Headphones came in a very nice carrying case with extra ear pieces and a charger. All in all I am very impressed with not only the headphones but with the sellers as well!!!!
5	:	I am loving these so far. I have had them about a month now and they have great sound and are very comfortable. I have bought many other bluetooth head phones and been very disappointed. I have even bought very exspensive one with disappointment.I tottaly recomend these.
1	:	I purchased these and they have never worked!!! I would like to return them and have them replaced with blue tooth buds that work!
5	:	"great stuff.fast charge. long lasting. listen to it for about 30 mins a day, usually needs to charge in more than 4 days.sound quality beats lots of major brand with higher price tag, wonder why....."
5	:	These earbuds are easy to pair to your Bluetooth device and the sound quality is very good. I own 2 other pair of earbuds and these have a much crisper sound than the others. These also have good sound canceling to keep out other outside noises.
5	:	Muy buenos hands free inal??mbricos
5	:	For the price these headphones have amazing range and sound.  Bass is excellent.  Fit is superb.  Highly recommended.
5	:	Works great and affordable price. Used with my Galaxy J7v phone with no issues.
5	:	"These are fantastic so far! Very comfortable, easy to use, and sound is great.  I  previously had the Powerbeats Bluetooth wireless earphones and these are much better and much more reliable-  Especially for a fraction of the price!! Highly recommend!"
5	:	Love it great present. Sounds amazing and it really cancels a lot of surround ing noise.
5	:	"Received my Turbo Soundwhiz today, and I am impressed of the crystal clear sound quality of this small device.  So far, I am satisfied and I hope it last me for many years to come. Do recommend it to try."
5	:	Great sound and very comfortable. Lots of different ear size options. Paired quickly with my iPhone and iPad. Only issue is I am having some trouble changing out the ear pieces. They fit very tight and I'm afraid I will rip them while pulling the off.
4	:	"I've only owned this product for 5 days.  I would generally wait to review something, but my email has been getting lit up by the company begging me to write a review so I'll jot one down for what I have experienced so far.Pros:-Comfortable-Nice case to store them-I like that it has a charging indicator light-Quite a few control options with the button (pause, play, skip, etc)Cons:-There's a decent amount of bass, but it kinda makes the treble sound muffled in a way.  Especially with podcasts-When you push the button on the side to pause or play the music, it's got about a second and a half delay delay.  It doesn't sound like a big deal, but I use these at work and when someone comes up to ask me a question, I can't hear the first few words they speak because of that delay.All I have used these for is listening to podcasts at work, and music at home while mowing the lawn or cleaning.  They've been a good set so far.  However, time always tells the real story when it comes to headphones, especially ones that are supposed to be bluetooth and waterproof.  We'll see how they hold up."
5	:	"Just got done with my first run. These headphones are terrific. They stay on my ear more solidly than another brand I???d tried previously. They pair easily, and the buttons are intuitive. Good batt life too! Highly recommend this product."
5	:	"Gift for my wife, and so far she loves them.  She even asked if they had active noise cancelling they did such a good job sealing out noise."
5	:	I just now received these today. So I can not attest to longevity nor battery life. I can tell you these Sound Much Better than the Tone Platinum 1100  by far at less than 1/3 of the price. No matter using  Amazon music app or my own downloaded music!!! Also Loudest and Crispest sound on bluetooth headsets I've ever owned !
4	:	"Got this as christmas gift and I think this product is awesome. It really is noise cancelling. It was easy to pair on my phone, sound quality is good too. Only giving it 4 stars because I still have to try it on a daily and see how long it???ll last. I???m lovin??? it so far."
4	:	"These are okay, however if you have small ear canals. They may not stay in."
5	:	"These headphones are great! I used Beats by Dre before this but once a little sweat got into those, they immediately broke. These SoundWhiz are great for working out and have lasted me a long time! Definitely recommend."
5	:	I love these headphones.  I use them at work to listen to music.  They fit in my ear well and have a great sound
5	:	"Very impressed with these headphones, sound is awesome and fits great to the ears! The set up was easy as turning the headphones on. I would recommend these headphones and dealing with SoundWhiz to anyone who's looking for a great Bluetooth head set, thanks again!"
5	:	The sound is great and the range of earbud sizes lets it fit anyone's ears! The battery life is as advertised; they lasted all day at work and did not hurt my ears.
5	:	Great sound quality and easy to use! Have yet to try answering calls with them but so far I am impressed. I really appreciate that they come with different sized earbuds seeing as I have very small ears and it's always been a pain for me to wear buds.
5	:	"Excellent sound, noise cancellation, battery life and a short time to charge it. Great to do exercises. On top of that the best thing is a the price."
5	:	"Best bass yet! Well done!  I love these headphones.  I need a pair for the office, a pair for the house and  a pair in my gym bag."
5	:	"These wireless earphones are the best I've owned recently, they don't come with a bulky body or lack in sound. They're perfect for the gym and for running. Regardless what it is you're going to use them for it's a great buy for the price and you get great customer service whenever you need it."
4	:	Not audiophile sound but good enough for running :-)
2	:	This is the second set my teenage son has purchased and broke within 3-5 months- this one at 4 months.
1	:	I get this type of headphones because the regular buds don't stay in my ears. So the plastic that goes around your ear should actually do the job of staying around your ear so the bud can stay in. The part that goes around your ear is so flimsy it might as well not even be there.
5	:	"I bought this pair as a replacement for my existing bluetooth earphones which stopped working during my workout (even though they were sweat proof). I like this product because it holds good, sounds awesome and fits well.It works well with sweat."
5	:	"I loved it, it has much more bass and more quality as my old Beats wireless headphones so thanks amazon."
5	:	It was the best buy i could make. The ear buds sound great . It also does so many amazing things.  You can even make phone calls with just one of the things it can do.I think its priced actually to low.but i say again great buy .
5	:	I love the case! The sound is good and the earplugs are ergonomic
5	:	The sound quality is amazing for both music & talking. It's quality is right up there with the more expensive brands for a fraction of the cost.
4	:	"The overall quality of the headphones is ok, but the controls are un-intuitive and a bit disappointing. To skip to the next song I have to press the big button for 5 seconds, a huge hassle while I am trying to run. The sound these produce is nice however and they do sit well on my ear."
5	:	works as expected very well
5	:	This thing went through the washer and the dryer and still powered on and use it till this day. Great purchase and value
5	:	I love these ear phones! I work out in them. I have Business meetings with them.Con: It picks up EVERY SOUND around you and it is magnified. (Especially when washing dishes...lol)Battery is long lasting.
4	:	"Noise cancellation is great for the gym. It's got pretty OK sound quality, but doesn't sound bad, and for the price point I can't find a better pair that don't get in my way, fall out, and have this level of connection quality. It'd be 5 stars if the audio quality was just a pinch higher."
4	:	Very impressed considering the price!
1	:	Would like to return or replace this itemI hope it's still under warranty
5	:	"Items shipped quickly, comes with a carrying case, and a 12 month warranty!"
5	:	Easy to setup with my PC.... Love being cordless
4	:	"Work very well. Battery, connectivity and noise cancellation are all very good. Sound is a little heavy on the bass, which is why I give them 4 stars."
5	:	"Lightweight ear pieces that fits easily. It has amazing sound quality, on top of that I got extraordinary customer support when I faced issue with Bluetooth pairing. I have never seen a better customer support than this. Totally happy to be part of Soundwhiz family."
5	:	"I use these primarily for yard work and they stay in contact better than another brand I tried. There???s some wind noise when riding a bicycle, but I imagine they all have that."
5	:	I love these headphones. They were very easy to set up. They fit comfortably and are perfect for working out. A great price and a great sound quality. The company is also super nice and helpful.
5	:	"Works well, fits well with multiple earbud change-out options. Got heavily rained on during a bike ride and these headphones performed perfectly throughout and still do several days later. Good sound, and even decent range when I wear them around my house. Overall satisfied and worth the money."
5	:	"Easy to pair with my phone, stays snugly in my ears, great quality sound with a decent distance range from my device. Love it!"
5	:	Hassle free while working out in the gym. No worries about them falling off or me being too far away from my phone. Good convenient quality! I???d recommend. Customer service is a great help with assistance and updates
3	:	"Sounds great, but loops are too big for ears.  Make them adjustable for bigger or smaller ears, or at least to be more secure when moving.  Even turning head causes one to dislodge."
1	:	Yeah they just one day decided to stop working!
4	:	"Easy set up, comfortable to wear. Does anyone know if you can swim with these on?"
5	:	"This is my first set of wireless Bluetooth headphones. Originally I was looking at a much more expensive pair, but read some good things on the SoundWhiz Turbo. After doing a little more digging around, I decided I'd buy them and give them a test to see how I'd like wireless headphones.LOVE my SoundWhiz!! I have since decided I'd be sticking with these. So far, I'm very impressed with the fit and finish. They look and feel like they should be more expensive. I even like the case that they came in. Also shipped with an assortment of different size eat pieces. I really like the sound quality. I feel like they have a nicely balanced sound, and a touch of extra bass. It took me a little playing around to get the seal right, but once I did the sound was wonderfully surprising.  The button design is really nice as well, they all double up to give built in media controls as well as being able to answer and end calls. I've got used to using my watch to control my phone's mp3 functions, but it's super convenient to use the buttons on the right ear piece as well.  It has a voice that lets you know when the battery is starting to get low. As far as battery life, I haven't ran a test to tell exactly how long they last. For my use, they have more then enough life. I just charge them up every few days and have only been told once that the battery was getting low.I was a little worried about the over the ear ""hooks"" or whatever they are called. But, they have a soft rubbery feel. Once I have them on, I don't even notice them. Taking off or putting on glasses/sunglasses doesn't require me to remove the headphones, and that's always a plus.As the title said, I'm very satisfied. I was very surprised with them overall. I wasn't getting be hopes up, and wasn't fully sure what to expect. I thought with a price point that low, they can't be that good... Very happy with them overall.If I had to think of a negative, it would be the length of the charging cord. I feel it is to short,  and this isn't really an issue for me (as I have other cords that will work that are longer).I'd say it'd be very hard to beat them for the money. I will (and have already) recommend to my friends."
3	:	very loud.
5	:	"I LOVE these wireless headphones. I have several, but these are the best quality and they are comfortable to wear."
5	:	"I currently have a Beat headphones that I purchased last year for I  believe $145,00. These headphones are wireless so I decided to give it a shot. Shockingly they are as good if not better then my Beat and cost a lot less. Customer service is excellent if you need help in pairing them."
5	:	"Unfortunately, my first pair broke, but after getting in contact with the company through email, they were able to send me a working new pair. The battery life's outstanding, and the level of water protection is just right. I would definitely recommend it to a friend."
5	:	"Turbo BT, Great sound with strong bass, works perfect with my moto z force. Cannot find a better Bluetooth headset for the price, very comfortable and works all day on one charge, distance and clarity excellent, I'm very pleased with this product."
5	:	"I initially bought them for the water protection, because my sweat has fried 2 other bluetooth headphones this year! Ended up being proud of all it's other features! Really nice bass!"
4	:	"I love these...they are comfortable and sound great...my only complaint is, mine don't always skip a song when I hold the button...it works about 3x, then stops (makes me feel like I'm listening to Pandora instead of my own music)"
5	:	"I love these headphones, great sound, very comfortable. Very easy to setup and a great at canceling noise!"
1	:	never worked w iphone
5	:	I bought these for a specific purpose which other wireless headphones have failed to deliver on. I am a musician and needed a set of wireless headphones to connect to my metronome and be loud enough for me to use in live playing situations. Most wireless headsets didn't deliver the volume I needed and these do without having to spend hundreds on an in ear custom headset. I so far am very pleased by them and only hope they don't crap out in 6 months like a lot of other wireless and wired sets seem to do. At this point I have no complaints and would recommend them.
5	:	quick delivery  easy to hook up  follow up on product also
5	:	"I've used Dre's beats before these and I can honestly say I will NEVER go back! These are the most comfortable earphones I've ever had, plus no wires to pull them out of your ears. Also the sound and bass are incredible for the price I paid. In my opinion I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for solid and reliable workout headphones"
2	:	Will not stay in my ear.
5	:	"It???s hard for me to find headphones that will stay in my ears, especially if I move. So far, so good for these.The sound quality is good too... no complaints!"
4	:	Sounds great. Pairing was easy. Not sure about battery life yet.
5	:	"I really like the product, I do have to say the ear piece hook could use some work like if was not so flimsy. Everything else is great! The sound is awesome, I have have found the battery life last longer than it says! I wear it at work for about 5 hours at 100% and I get home and it still has 70%. So it really is a great product!"
5	:	"Not only are these headphone high-quality and sound great, but the customer service of this company is beyond good!  Any time I've had an issue they've resolved it immediately and with no hassle at all.  I'll be a soundwhiz customer for life..."
1	:	"**  So my new review is not good.  Loved these at first, even bought my husband a pair for Christmas.  They just went down hill from then.  If I had to rate just customer service I would give them 5/5 stars for sure.  They are fantastic and quick to respond.  They replaced my first pair of headphones that would ""glitch"" at no cost.  Then I had the same issue....bought another pair and again...same issue.  I contacted customer service and they sent me another pair at no charge but said they've never had this issue.  But again, same thing.  My husband is now saying his headphones go out while on his runs too...so I'm sure we will be replacing those soon.  So I'm throwing in the towel on these...I've moved on to the Mpow Flame Bluetooth Headphones Waterproof IPX7, Wireless Earbuds Sport, Richer Bass HiFi Stereo In-Ear Earphones w/ Mic, Case, 7-9 Hrs Playback Noise Cancelling Headsets (Comfy & Fast Pairing).  These have been great.  I've worn them for a week now on my runs...no problems!  Will review them again after longer use!I have only used these one time so far.  I originally bought the Sound Whiz Bluetooth Running Headphones Sweat proof and did not like them so the great customer service recommended the Turbo and gave me 20% off.  I ran with the Turbo today and they are much better than the original purchase.  The foam ear pieces are awesome.  I can't ever find ear pieces that fit well and stay in my ear.  The only problems I had today was that the sound kept ""glitching"" in and out.  Not sure if it was the connection or what.  At one point I was running in complete silence until the connection glitched back on.  The other issue I had is that the indicator light (a little dot next to the ear piece) doesn't light up.  I returned the first pair of Turbos because of this and got another pair (unfortunately I didn't get the 20% off for these :( ) and the same issue happened so I guess that little dot doesn't indicate power/connection.  The light blinks through a little opening on the side of the ear piece that I can see....other than that I think I will like these.  The customer service is great.  Jo is quick to respond and help in any way."
4	:	"These work great and sound terrific. The only downside I found was that the rubber cover for the charging slot can easily be knocked out of place. Other than that, awesome"
1	:	Way too bulky. They stick out
4	:	"I didnt feel satisfied that my purchase was new. The seals on the box were cut and the contents appeared tampered with. My wife , who they were for is an active gym enthusiast really needed them so she started using them."
5	:	"Bought as a Christmas gift, has not been given yet."
5	:	"delivered as promised.  Great product and fits my needs.  Has great sound, fits well and doesn't fall off. Easy to use."
5	:	The earbuds are really amazing wireless buds.  They fit perfectly into my ears and stsu in all while canceling out the sounds around me.  The sound is really great as well.  It sounds like earbuds that would cost 3 to 4 times more.  I highly recommend theses
2	:	"I really wanted to like these since they had such great reviews and were extremely affordable for bluetooth headphones, but sadly they were not for me.PROS- Very comfortable. It barely felt like I had anything on.- Lots of bud options - They come with a bunch of different ear bud options (sizes and type) so you're bound to find a good fit.- Customer service is greatCONS- Very bass heavy - Some people prefer that, and if you do, these are definitely a good option for you, but for me, there was way too much bass.- Sound sounds muted - This was weird to me considering how heavy the bass was, but the sound was a bit muted.- Stick out/noticeable on your ears - I'm a girl so they may look better on a bigger dude, but on me, these stuck out too much. My boyfriend even mentioned it without prompting an ask of how they looked."
5	:	I used these everyday for 2 months and then suddenly they stopped charging. I contact the company and they expedited another set to me. Best workout headphones ever and amazing customer service. Definitely recommend!
3	:	"An important note on this product is that the plastic piece that goes over top of the ear is actually very floppy rubber. I've tried to figure out and read up as to why that would be helpful and cannot find anything. For me, it's extremely unhelpful. It provides no balance against the ear and also somehow makes putting the actual headphones into your ears more complicated, especially if, as they have done before, a headphone falls out while you're running. Trying to get the things back on while running feels like trying to handle a wet spaghetti noodle.This one detail is a bummer because overall, the sound and the battery are good. The connection is touch and go. I run with my iphone in a pokcet on the rear of my shorts and sometimes, simply turning my head a certain way will trigger some static. Perhaps this is because I'm in a crowded metro area (LA).Lastly, they provide two types of ear buds, each with 3 size options (S, M, L). I ended up needing the largest size, and only one of the two types fit snug enough to withstand sweat and long workouts.Overall... the floppy ear piece, the strange static and the lack of a larger ear bud adapter make me have reservations whole-heartedly recommending this."
5	:	"I love these headphones! I honestly do not know how I functioned before bluetooth headphones. The sound is great and they are comfortable. They hold their charge for a long time, too. Highly recommended! You really can't beat them, especially at this price!"
5	:	"Headphones are light, battery life is great, price is right.  What more could you ask for in a 'budget' set of headphones?"
4	:	"I've been using these for almost two months now and they are holding up very well. They stay in my ear pretty snug, and sound great."
5	:	"Great sound. They come with a nice case and additional parts in case you need to replace the earbuds. Their customer service is incredible, they're very polite and helpful. I'm really pleased with supporting this company and their products."
2	:	"Not good for running.  Something shakes inside of them, and it???s very distracting."
4	:	Works great.
5	:	"My first experience with Bluetooth headphones, and I wasn't disappointed! The battery life is phenomenal. I can take these on three 10+ mile runs and not have to recharge them. They pair seamlessly with my iPhone and MacBook, and the sound quality is phenomenal. I highly recommend."
4	:	Quality product and sound!  Like the comfort level of this product.  Fits well and has many ear size options!
4	:	"These headphones are very comfortable and stay in place well during all of my activities including running, cycling and high impact workouts at the gym. Good sound quality as well. Only negatives are sometimes you get interference with the wind."
4	:	Good sound. Still getting the hang of them but like very much.
4	:	"These are a pretty good set of headphones. For the low price, you get pretty good bass, the sound quality is great. I'd recommend it to anyone who is physically active, or just looking for a good pair of headphones for a cheap price."
2	:	"Constantly moves out of my hears. This is not a running headphone as advertise, I would not recommend it to anyone."
1	:	I loved them until they just died.  They were my favorite.
5	:	"Received the package this morning. Product's quality is more than what is expected. Easy to pair with your phone, easy to turn it off/on and sound quality is great!!!"
5	:	"soundwhiz are the best headphones I own , and your service is outstanding AAAA++++  Thanks  Riaz"
5	:	Great Bluetooth earphones for the price. I use them almost every day.
4	:	Good sound. My only complaint is that the mic picks up background noise and can be heard by others on my calls. Sometimes people complain that it's hard to hear me talking. I like the over the ear design but still trying to get the ear pieces to fit in my ears correctly.
5	:	One of my favorite headphones for working out nice to have them sit and not be falling everwhere. Sound quality is pretty good and I like that it comes with replacement ear buds.
5	:	So far it works. No complaints. I like thta it came wit a box!! Now I can't lose it ????????????.
5	:	Great sound quality and they definitely last more than the 6-8 hours claimed! Very happy so far.
5	:	Awesome sound and I love the bass sound it gives off.  The features are easy to use.  And the price wasn't bad at all...I love the fact that they are wireless..It's made going to the gym better and freer!
5	:	"Best headphones I've ever used - hands down. They have great sound quality and most importantly, never fall out/off my ears during any of my lifts or workouts. Would easily assume these headphones would run double the cost based on the quality. Very satisfied!"
5	:	"So far I am very pleased. The sound quality is very good. It has the perfect amount of bass for my taste, but it does not bury the mid and higher ranges. They were very easy to pair with my iPhone."
5	:	"Have trouble keeping regular headphones in place, these work great! Everything I was looking for and more. Would buy them again, great product!"
5	:	"My 15 & 13 year old grandsons set me up and taught me how to operate this amazing technology!  Thank you for the offer to help, but I'm covered!"
5	:	"Better than expected, my grandson loves them. the battery last long time and they charge in less than 1 hour"
5	:	I love this headset nice range and very easy to pair and use. I have no complaints.
4	:	Very good bluetooth headphones that really don't lose their connection with my Apple phone.
5	:	"The headset is comfortable to wear, and it stays in place while running. The sound is pretty good for earbuds. The case is pretty handy when you carry the headset around, you don't have to be afraid of damaging it in your backpack etc."
5	:	"Sound quality is amazing and they have never fallen out of my ears. At some point they broke for an unknown reason but after contacting SoundWhiz, I was sent a new pair the same day and had it in my hands two days later. Could not recommend more!"
5	:	"Great Headphones.  I use them mainly for exercising and for phone meetings and the quality/ease of use is amazing.  Furthermore, SoundWhiz is by far the best customer service I have experienced for any electronics product; period!  Buy them and feel assured that SoundWhiz is going to take care of you no matter what.Enjoy,"
4	:	great for the price. Great job cancelling out external noise. Sound quality is decent. Not disappointed
5	:	Great sound
5	:	Just received these wireless headphones and I love them. An email arrived before the box with a quick explanation on how to set them up. It made the process very easy. The sound quality is great with good noise cancelling. Worth the price!
4	:	Used this product everyday for running.  Lasted a month and six days! Frustrating!!Edit:  You have to love a company that sticks by there product!  Thanks Jo for taking care of a defective item when you didn't have to. This doesn't happen very often and I will look for your products in the future!!
2	:	"Great headphones, but horrible customer service, I???ve contacted whiz, multiple times and they never get back to me about my warranty."
5	:	Easy to set up. Even a tech-challanged person like me can be enjoying the fantastic sounds in minutes. You will not be disappointed!
1	:	I have had this item for approximately 2 months. I charge the head phones routinely and now they won't hold a charge for more that 45 mins at a time.
5	:	"These headphones are great - the setup directions are very clear and easy to use, the sound quality is great, the design of the headphones is useful and the case is convenient. Would definitely recommend."
5	:	My son loves them! Best gift ever!
5	:	I love it once I got it and I ordered one for my son.
5	:	"i like it. i like the small touches they do, like you giving you a lot of customizable pieces for your ear. it looks great, and isn't bulky"
5	:	Amazing sound quality and supper comfy (even with my glasses)! Best headphones I have ever had! Would recommend to anyone
5	:	Great Sound! Great base! solid product
5	:	Excellent product. Sounds great and easy to use.
5	:	I took a chance on these based on the reviews. I have used these for the last 5 days since receiving them. They are incredibly comfortable and the sound is great. I do some intensive training in loud environments and these headphones are by far the best I've used.
5	:	"These are great earbuds for the price. My 1st pair stoped working after 4 months, but Jo from SoundWiz made getting a replacement pair fast and easy. I would buy from SoundWiz again."
4	:	love them
5	:	I love how powerful these earphones are! No more annoying background music in the gym!Plus they are so easy to use and charge pretty fast. I've already had a few friends buy and love them too.
5	:	Amazing love them great sound easy to use while running. Blue tooth works great with my iPhone

5	:	"Very comfortable headphones, fit right out of the packet. No issues with pairing and the sound is pretty good for this price point. Good headphones for the gym."
4	:	"I just got my headphones the other day and so far LOVE them. The sound is great, I love the foam hear things. Feel nice in my ears. Great price. What I dont like is they are kinda bulky."
5	:	"Was a little confused when I first used them, but since then they have been a gem.  Are very comfortable to wear and have good sound quality."
4	:	Nice sounds for a good price. I love the noise cancelling they block out everyone in the gym. They work great with my Android phone I definitely recommend then.
5	:	So easy to set-up and sound quality is great.Wireless Bluetooth Running Headphones - SoundWhiz Noise Cancelling Waterproof Workout Earbuds - w Mic & Siri. Best Sport Headphones 8 Hours Play
4	:	"Great headphones! I use them when running and working out. The little 'hooks' that go over your ear are very flexible which makes them slight flimsy, but they work great for what I'm using them for. The buttons on the headphones are easy to use and convenient. I would recommend."
5	:	I love my new earphones. I reordered 3 more for friends and family.
5	:	"Very comfortable to wear, sounds is good"
5	:	"Sound great, and stay on. The buttons are a nice, easy function to use/change music."

They have treated me like I actually matter. I highly recommend these if you and into great sound and affordable price.
5	:	"Love how these headphones fit, great sound, Bluetooth connects well. They also have great customer service if any issues come up."
1	:	Looks like I waited to late to request a refund.  I ran using these headphones about 3 times and they all of sudden quit working. They wont seem to charge.  They won't even turn on.
5	:	I love these ear buds. The sound quality is awesome. I use them when I'm riding my Harley and have no issues with the clarity of the sound. Great customer service as well..
2	:	"Not worth the money, loose fit around the ear and sound quality isn't that great"
3	:	They still get wet and tje earpiece slips. Good sound though!

3	:	good for the money

1	:	"I owned this for about 3wks or so and used it maybe a half dozen times before the left ear bud shorted out. I was on the treadmill, heard static distortion, and then nothing. Waste of money."
5	:	Works great for me.

5	:	"Awesome sound,I have run with it and it doesn't come off it stays intact."

5	:	Great sound

5	:	Great wireless headphones at a terrific price
5	:	"I used the Turbo at the gym today and thought they were great.  However, they did cut out on me several times.  It was probably my phone.  They stayed out in my ears and are easy to operate.  This product deserves a 5 star rating.  We will see in time how they hold up."
2	:	I got these headphones in June and primarily use them while I'm at work.  I've been very pleased with them up until yesterday when they stopped charging.  Headphones should not stop working after 3 months :(

5	:	"Love love love. Super happy to get for FREE the 2 year warranty as I have bought 5 pair of BT headphones in the past 2 years. Figured I couldn't go wrong. The comfort, ease of connection are spot on. Their communication with the buyer is great as well. Highly recommend.1 year after purchase: I am still in love with this product and on another note, I had a small issue with my headphones and I sent an email to Sound Whiz customer service and bing bam boom, I have a brand new pair under their 2 year warranty I signed up for, for free, when I purchased my first pair. I highly recommend these ear buds. They are comfortable, they really block outside sound, and they have a great battery life. I use mine everyday and every night and they are still going strong. For the price you can't go wrong!!"
5	:	"These headphones pack a lot of power and are priced just right. A great substitution for the iPhone 7 headphones without breaking the budget. I'm sold on not having a headphone jack, less wires to be concerned with. Great product!"
4	:	Received promptly!  Comes with a great travel case and lots of different sizes of earbuds for comfort and a great sound.
3	:	Sound volume is good.Sound quality varies from apps.Stability while running average.
5	:	"So far I???m going to say this head set has surpassed my expectations for a $30.00 dollars. I use them daily for long periods of time and have lasted throughout the day. Only time will tell of they last, but so far are great for the price."
5	:	These are great and compare with the large brands. Would strongly recommend for those on a budget.
5	:	The product is truly outstanding!!! In fact Me and my wife love them so much that I have bought four pair year alone..... Yes their great!!!!!!!!! To me their better than the Dre  beats ear phone sets by Dre. If the  be told !!!!!! Now you know!!! So buy the best for less!!!! SoundWhiz  the best!!!!!
4	:	"Nice buds, probably could have gotten comparable ones cheaper"
5	:	Easy to use! Works as expected! No problems with connecting to iPhone. I have used it on runs and bike rides it stays on my ear and never comes loose. Strongly recommend.
5	:	Easy-to-use and sounds great!
1	:	Sound was going in and out and eventually stopped working after a few months.
5	:	"Just buy them, they work and sound great. I wear them in a hot tub almost everyday and no issues whatsoever. Seems like the company has really great support, and easy to contact."
5	:	"Sound is good, fit well, easy to pair, battery lasts long time... I definitely recommend!"
4	:	"Good product with this price, comfortable, sound is great. fit exactly my needs."
5	:	Great sound and fit.Beats the Dre and is less expense
4	:	Love it. The ear peice is a little big I have small ears. I love they sent an email with a phone number so you can call them if you need help. I love the sound that comes out of the. It's just a little big for me.
5	:	I love these! I use them for running on a treadmill and they pair easily with more than one device.
5	:	Lightweight and has a great sound. Easy to use. Connects easily with my IPhone
5	:	I was impressed with how well these worked immediately.  I just paired and was ready to go!  And I love the case.  Perfect purchase!
5	:	Extremely surprised out how great these headphones sound!. Definitely worth the investment!!
4	:	Bought these for my sister to go running and they seem like good quality. She loves the color and the box it comes in. So far she has had no problems with it - one week in after receiving them.
5	:	"I like these headphones a lot. This is my first set of Bluetooth headphones and they are a dream. Great sound, nice Bass, lightweight, and connectivity is as easy as can be. Definitely recommend."
5	:	These fit very well and are super easy to use even with gloves on while running.  I???ve used them on a few run and in a race already this year and really like them.
4	:	works well.
5	:	liked it so much I bought them early Christmas gifts
4	:	"Easy set up, great sound quality. I like the design, they stay put on my ears very well"
5	:	"My Wife loves them with her iPhone 7. Jogging & walking the dog, also links to the iWatch."
5	:	Perfect. Paired effortlessly.  The assortment of plugs was useful for plugging the Bluetooth into a variety of applications.
5	:	Works great.Arrived quick.
4	:	"It was initially uncomfortable, but once I changed the tips (they provide different types of ear buds) the sound quality was great and it was more comfortable.  Good product and great sound for the price."
5	:	WOrk really well. Stay charged at least 4 hours!
1	:	I was excited about the headphone but a few days after I started using they won???t charge. Now I???m stuck with broken headphone. They also started to rattle while I was running with them. Not happy with the product.
1	:	3 months after it was purchased one of the earbuds stopped working.  Like there was a short in the wire or something.  Won't be recommending or buying again
5	:	Awesome earbuds! I use them while working out and I've yet to experience any troubles at all. Multiple choices in buds for the ears and they really stay put. I would recommend these to a friend without hesitation.
4	:	Great product for the price but my friend said that they don???t last an year long. They offer an years warranty which is great.
5	:	My husband works out and he love them
5	:	Love my soundwhiz headphones. The clarity is very clear and great sound. The customer service is outstanding and got my product within days of ordering. Thanks again Soundwhiz!! ????????
5	:	When it says turbo it means turbo. The sound is amazing.
4	:	So far I am liking these a lot. I've gone through 3 pair of Beats Wireless and wanted to try another product. So far the only problem I've had is when I connected them to my IPod nano. They cut out ALOT when I went running. Other than that I'm impressed with the product so far and I like the customer service!
5	:	"I have tried 3 different wireless headphones and none of them fit/stayed in my ears/had good quality. These headphones are fantastic! They fit with ease, the sound quality is great and for an affordable price! Highly recommend!"
5	:	Works great. Great price. Just what I was looking for.
5	:	I have had two other Bluetooth ear buds and they were terrible. SoundWhiz stay in my ears and fit good with my glasses. The sound is also very good. I am very pleased!
5	:	Great sound. Excellent battery life. Was very impressed by the bass capacity. Connect them and pull up  a bass competition video on YouTube and you will see what I mean.
5	:	Delivered on time and work great!
1	:	"Received the item, paired well with my phone off the bat. A minute into my workout heard a loud buzz and they sutures off. Tried again and the same problem continues. Not sure if it was a fluke, but they do not work at all."
4	:	Awesome headphones...... battery meeting expectations.Took a few days to get used to.  Be careful learning navigation. Easy to accidentally call someone!
5	:	"SOUND IS GREAT, BATTERY LIFE LASTS LONG, I LOVE IT."
5	:	Great headphones and extra long range.  You can use these in a completely different room than the device you are paired to.  Great quality sound and easy to use.  Battery life is great too!
5	:	I love how loud they get and the way they fit thx
5	:	Great wireless headphones for the money sound quality was a good bit better then I was expecting all around great product for the price
2	:	When I put I phone in my pocket they kept losing their connection.  Annoying!!
5	:	Great sound and fit. Rich deep base! Very easy to set up. Amazing sound for the compact size
4	:	Good but watch for interference on signal on certain wifi
1	:	Well have had it 3 months and already quit working. Very disappointed
5	:	"The sound quality is awesome , more volume than beats . So far I like them better than any wireless headphones I've  owened in the past,thank you!"
5	:	Excellent sound quality. Great fit. Connects quickly and without issue. Having the music controls on the headset is perfect for running when you don't want to mess with your phone/MP3 player.
5	:	"I absolutely love these. Great sound, great range, lightweight and comfortable."
1	:	"The headphones melted while they were charging 7 months after i got them. i use them every morning for 1 hour at the gym..... awful product, stay away"
2	:	The parts that hook over the ears are way too big. I have relatively small ears and was hoping these would fit but no luck.
5	:	Excellent sound quality and the best headset I have owned
4	:	This is a solid and stylish set of headphones. Good sound quality and easy to use controls on the ear piece. Overall a great product for the price!
5	:	Great headphones! Just about a second pair for my son.
1	:	Waste of money. While running they fall out easily. To put them in you usually touch the power button. Range is less than 2 feet from device.
5	:	This is amaze! Sound is great. Fits good and quality is dope for the prize!
5	:	These are perfect ????. Bluetooth connection was quick and easy.It's all good ????
5	:	Headphones lasted six months then one earbud stopped working. Company responded immediately and replaced with a new set free of charge. Sound is good quality.
5	:	A wonderful product!
4	:	Best pair of workout headsets I had in awhile. Only had one problem with them and soundwhiz quickly handle it for me. Why buy beats when these have equal quality to $200 competitors. Would happily be open to trying or buying any new soundwhiz products.
5	:	A++++
4	:	"The sound is very good. I have a hard time getting comfortable with ear sets, but these give many options, and work well."
5	:	The product is absolutely durable. I have it for working out I.e. running with a training mask and with the mask the headphones don't come out and I constantly don't have to adjust them. The sound quality is above standard meaning it's loud and clear.
5	:	AWESOME headphones! VERY HAPPY with the quality and preformance. Am ordering another set for my son. A must have!!!
4	:	Earbuds are great! The only thing that keeps me from giving a 5 star review is that when I???m in certain places the Bluetooth connection comes & goes.
5	:	WORK GREAT SOUND IS GOOD AND HAS ALL THE OPTIONS I NEED
1	:	After a week they stopped working wouldn???t hold a charge or stay on not happy at all.
5	:	"I love them!  At first I thought they were going to be too big and bulky but they fit perfect and they don't come off your ear.  I wear glasses and when exercising, I move hard & fast and sweat a lot...they stay put.  About three months into owning these I did have a weird malfunction where they wouldn't turn on. I contacted the company and not only received an e-mail (on a weekend) they immediately made it right & sent me a new pair.  They then followed up, making sure it arrived in good order and that I was happy.  I was impressed!  That was awesome customer service.  I've bought a pair for my wife too...she too loves hers.  The Bluetooth distance is amazing.  I workout in the basement and occasionally will forget my phone, walking upstairs, wandering around listening to music before realizing my phone is still downstairs.  It's simply the best BT connectivity I've experienced yet.  The battery life is good also. A good strong 8-9 hours.  It will warn you when your battery is getting low but shuts off shortly thereafter so be prepared.  The case that comes with it is good...sufficient for what you pack in it...the earphones, cord, replacement buds and that's about it.  They're more on the expensive side but so far, I'd say I've gotten what I expected...good quality sound from a good quality company.Thanks soundwhiz!"
5	:	Gave this to my nephew as a birthday gift and he loves it.  Great purchase for an active athlete!
5	:	Love the quality sound. Ease of use.
5	:	There have Good sound quality and noise cancellation! Love them
4	:	very good. hangs on the ears fine. music quality 7/10. good bass. one flaw is battery life. last about 3 hours max
1	:	Way to clunky and big for my ears. Wanted to wear them while I run. Not being able to return them is dispointing.
1	:	"I really enjoyed this set of wireless headphones, I wore them to the gym on a daily basis, unfortunately they only lasted about 5 months before they stopped working. It seems as though they can no longer hold a charge."
5	:	"Wonderful product, and works fantastic! I'm highly pleased with these headphones! They're perfect for cleaning the house, working out, jogging, everyday use, you name it! If you're looking for relatable headphones then you've found them!"
5	:	I am very happy with the way these fit around my ear so that there is no slip while working out. Definitely better than other brands I have tried
5	:	"Had some issues with the sound after a month, but customer service was extremely helpful and a reset fixed the issue."
5	:	My headphones arrived yesterday!!!  They came with a partial charge and I was able to pair them quickly and easily to my iPhone 7 plus.  Went for a run with them today in the rain and I was very happy with the sound quality and comfort.
5	:	Had an issue with the product and they backed it 100% and had me a replacement by the end of the week! will definitely be doing more business with them. Highly recommended company.
5	:	Inexpensive and durable.  Good value.  Not the highest quality for classical music or mega bass but great for running.
3	:	Not bad. I had to change the rubber. Apple headphones have better sound fidelity.
1	:	While using my iPhone 6s  there was a continuous echo in the earpiece. Returned
5	:	Amazing for working out... first headphones that haven't fell out while jump roping... only had them for 2 weeks but so far they are great!
4	:	I like them the only thing is they need metal inside the plastic that goes around the ears to make them more stable.
5	:	Amazing quality at a great price.
5	:	"I bought these for my wife and she loves them so far. Great for working out, good quality , and a value for the price"
5	:	"Great headphones. Just received them and the sound is better than I thought it would be. Very lightweight. Many different earbuds for comfortable listening. Haven't worn them very long yet; however , I believe the could be worn for long periods very comfortably."
3	:	Comfortable to wear.  Left side ear bud makes a weird noise when connected to my phone.  Very distracting and annoying.
5	:	The sound quality blows away my powerbeats2 and less than half the price.Enough said.
5	:	This is a very good product for the price. I have not had any trouble pairing it with my device and the sound is very good. I love it.
5	:	I'm enjoying swimming laps and listening to my favorite audiobooks. This is just the ticket to long swims! The sound quality is great for what I need.
4	:	"Love them so far!! Water/Sweat proof, great sound and cheap. Only complain is the in-ear fitting, coming from a Jabra Sport+, these feel loose, I hope this sensation changes with use. Battery last longer. Overall, a good replacement for the Jabra."
4	:	"Pretty comfortable, easy to pair and sound is also good.  The fact it comes with a case is a great bonus.  Overall a good pair of wireless headphones for the price"
5	:	Excellent sound. Comfortable to wear- dont have to worry about cables getting caught with any objects. Pairing is easy. Use it between tablet and phone. Clear sound.
4	:	The only thing I didn???t like about them is that they have too much bass
5	:	Used these for over a month now. They have great sound for the price and stay in place while I'm running.  Best earbuds I've had for lots of bass. Excellent battery life as well..
5	:	"Absolutely great sound, and their warranty response is first class.  The overall package -- carrying case etc. is also very nice."
5	:	I'm a Bose speaker fan and this was a great buy for price and value.  Nice case easy to use
5	:	very happy with the purchase. I'm very pleased with the sound.
1	:	"The headphones worked great for the first few times I used them, but within 10 uses or so the left headphone stopped working.  I hate giving a one star review but breaking so soon after purchase is simply unacceptable."
2	:	I don???t like it because i think it???s big in Ears ugly
4	:	"Perfect for workout use. Sound is great and gets paired easily. It gives out little trouble with the connection when used for calls, otherwise overall a good buy."
5	:	"First pair of wireless headphones I've purchased, after trying many, that fit my small ears and did not fall out during my run.  Set-up was easy, they fit comfortably and the sound quality was good.  Customer service was excellent as well!"
5	:	"Blown away by these, love them!"
1	:	Not sweat proof. Don???t work 3 months after use.
5	:	"Excellent sound and the headphones stay in place with running, yoga and even gardening.  I've tried other brands and have always been disappointed, spending more time trying to keep them in place then exercising."
5	:	"Just used these at the gym for the first time and wow what a difference! Lightweight, comfortable, great sound (definitely noise canceling). Super easy setup. Love!"
1	:	I purchased this product and it died out after usage for a few months.
5	:	Taken on a few runs so far. Work great. I would recommend these for anyone who runs or lifts or both.
5	:	"These earbuds sound terrific - highs and mids are clear, bass is punchy and full. They stay put regardless of sweat. My only complaint is a slight bit of wind noise coming from the microphone while I'm biking at high speeds. Very comfortable and good quality along with a low price."
4	:	These fit well and don't fall out very easy. Battery lasts for about a week at a time.
5	:	I'm enjoying these Bluetooth earbuds quite a bit. Recommended!
5	:	"I set these up today and am very pleased! It was a super easy setup, the buds are comfortable, and have a great sound."
5	:	great!
3	:	"Ok, but not real nice sound quality."
4	:	"great sound, comfortable to wear, connects to blue tooth with no troubles. I've had it for about a month and use it while running with no problems."
4	:	Great sound and battary life
4	:	Love the color and the ease of use. The sound and battery life is awesome!!
5	:	I just received it and so far I'm in love
5	:	"I like the sound quality, the nice package and that they are very comfortable. The price is very good for the product you get."
5	:	"They are wonderful! Great sound, easy to use and no problems falling out of ear!"
4	:	I would like them to fit more snugly around the ear but other than that I love them!
5	:	Love that it provides several sizes and types of earbuds to choose from.  I've looked a long time looking for a pair that fit my smaller ear canal.
4	:	"Great headphones. I used them today, and they stayed on for my full workout. They sounded very good for the price point."
5	:	"Really like the simplicity of these ear buds. Very easy to link with device. Smartly designed, with intuitive on/off and volume buttons. Comfortable to wear.Very affordable price."
2	:	Headphones continually disconnect then reconnects to bluetooth while talking!! You get what you pay for I guess.
5	:	Great for the price. Bass is good and good noise canceling. Easy to pair with phone and can't beat the warranty. Worth every penny. Sweat proof and can wash off with water. Also controls are very easy to use and stays in ears well
5	:	"Excellent Product, superb sound, Customer Service follow up to the next level, makes super easy the warranty process subscription"
5	:	I already love my headphones as soon as I got them. They are easy to use and have all you need to get through your workout.
5	:	Thanks so much. That was a little present to my husband he is so happy
5	:	I???m a Bose headphone guy. But I have to admit this headphones are phenomenal !! Great price and quality product . I can???t workout without them
2	:	Very uncomfortable for using during workouts. The ear pieces keeps popping out.
5	:	Love them!!Wireless Bluetooth Running Headphones - SoundWhiz Waterproof Workout Earbuds - w Noise Cancelling Microphone & Siri. Best Sport Headphones 8 Hours Play
5	:	Great buy.
5	:	"These are some of best wireless headphones you're going to find on Amazon and comes with a company that will help you and stand behind their product and warranty (just send them an email!).I love these headphones and can't live without them when I head to the gym. They fit perfectly around and in my ear and are really comfortable fit and the setup is extremely easy. I also love the sound quality of these bad boys, they do a great job and pushing music into your ear drum for maximum listening pleasure (they also can get pushed to a very nice loud volume).OH! And don't even worry about the Bluetooth connection being choppy at reasonable distances, I often find myself away from my phone at ranges up at least 15-20 feet away and have zero problems!So don't fall for the other wireless headphones that can cost upwards of $70, just go with these. You'll enjoy the experience."
5	:	"Very easy to link and use. Very comfortable.  Great sound for the price. Nice full sound with good bass, but not overpowering"
5	:	"Ordered these for my husband and he is loving them. They are perfect for his morning run, and workout routine at the gym. He also said that they are the most comfortable earphones he has ever owned!"
1	:	Garbage . Had two of them and they both broke .
1	:	"When I received these the sound was pretty good.  After awhile though, I could not charge them anymore.  They do not last long."
5	:	Love the product! Keep up the excellent work!
1	:	Garbage. Got a few months out of them but now they disconnect after 10 minutes of use. Not good sport Bluetooth headphones. Waste of money.
1	:	"The bluetooth connectivity is very poor, cuts in and out. Even at full charge it is poor. Looked to return it, but was past the return date. Need to find a completely different set now. Poor, poor quality."
5	:	Excellent product and shipped super fast !!
1	:	Terrible product had it for 6 weeks and it won't keep a charge
5	:	Work great at the gym and while doing the yard.
5	:	"I was looking for a convenient pair of headphones to commute with than my Sony MDR-7506s. While almost anything travels better than the Sonys, nothing sounds better at their price. That said, I kept my expectations realistic. I wanted something wireless that I could shove in a pocket. I didn't need studio quality reproduction, I just needed something to make the subway a bit more pleasant.I first purchased the Senso S-250 earbuds. I found the bass too boomy and uncontrolled, but what killed them for me was that one of the pods broke in half after a couple weeks of use. After returning them, I purchased these Aukey earbuds, and they've been great!ConvenienceThe footprint of these earbuds is miniscule. I can wad them up and throw them in a pocket and forget they're there. Spatial convenience achieved. Especially coming from the big over-ear Sonys, the smallness of these buds is amazing to me. These are my first wireless headphones (other than the short-lived Sensos), so I don't have much of a baseline for evaluating the battery life. They can usually hold charge through two round trips to work and back (at least 6 hours), which satisfies me. I've gotten in the habit of charging them alongside my phone when at work, and that seems to be all they need.They can connect to multiple devices simultaneously, which is mostly convenient. I have to say that the execution isn't perfect here, because when both my phone and iPad are connected, I have noticed that they playback will drop out for a blip here and there. It's a small problem, but annoying enough that I usually have to make sure to disconnect whichever device I am not playing audio from. Reconnecting is fairly painless though. If these had cost more than $50, I'd have taken a star for this, but at $30, I'm can deal with it.SoundSurprisingly good! I wouldn't try to mix a recording with these, but for the listening environment in which I employ these (NYC subways), they never leave me wanting for more. The bass is full and slightly boosted, yet controlled. The trebles are clear, but never painful. I'd say the sound quality is on par with the Apple EarPods, but these fit my ears much better and seal out a lot more external noise. These are the same price as the Sensos, but provide a much more pleasurable listening experience.My only other potential gripe is that I wish the low battery warning was more obvious. While the battery life is good, it really sucks to suddenly be without sound when I've forgotten to bring a book. Overall very satisfied though. Recommended and would buy these again."
4	:	"So here is the deal. I have had these headphones 1 day and I love them so far, with just 1 exception. They fit great (especially if you are used to an ear bud headphone). If you are used to Apple headphones, it will take some adjusting but overall pretty comfortable. The sound is amazing. Even on the lowest volume, it totally drowns out all that is around.The wire and volume buttons definitely feel a little cheap, but for the price you cant beat it.The only issue I have is that I have an Iphone, and use Siri quite a bit. There is no way to use Siri by using the controls on the headphones. Not a deal breaker, but something i will have to adjust to. Secondly, there is not any noise cancellation for background noise on the mic. People have told me that the background noise is very loud when I am on the phone, when people are just talking 10-15 feet awayOverall, very pleased with this purchase."
4	:	"I found these from a WireCutter review, I needed to replace wired headphones and thought I would jump on the Bluetooth bandwagon. What I wanted in a new pair of headphones is primarily *durability,* followed by decent battery life and as few connection problems as possible. The durability is important because I wear one under a full face helmet when I ride; the other with control under my shirt or jacket. I previously had a ~$125 pair of Bose that sounded great but lasted less than a year - the constant rubbing on the earpiece severed the wire inside the earpiece.So far, these are great! They seem very durable, they fit very well under my helmet, the control is easy to manipulate through leather gloves, battery life is better than I would expect for such a light/compact pair, and they isolate from outside noise very very well - which means I don???t have to blast the volume to hear what I want to listen to! Another big benefit is the cost. If the wear and tear from being under a helmet does destroy them sooner than I would like, it???s much easier replacing a set of these than some that cost 4x as much.  I???m not an audiophile, I mostly listen to talk radio and podcasts, so I can???t speak to the quality and clarity... it???s good enough for me.The reason I took off a star is hard to explain. When both are snugly in my ears, I hear like a BOOM BOOM BOOM when I walk. Maybe it???s the cord bouncing on my back? Also when chewing I hear all the grinding going on in my head. But I think that???s a testament to how well they isolate the sound. If you???re using these while sitting at work, doing dishes, etc they are fan-tastic!  I???m thinking to get a second pair to rotate sets as the batteries die."
5	:	"After a few days of using these, I can certainly say these are absolutely way worth buying, especially considering the price.The sound quality is better than I expected, although perhaps technically the sound is just very slightly thin, but altogether these sound pretty good; very similar to some good wired earbuds I used before: clear, loud, absolutely robust enough sound, with some good bass. The noise isolation works ok, too.Battery life is definitely good, and it takes around an hour to recharge.Haven't made too many phone calls with these, but in interior spaces the microphone seems to work just fine.Using the big size tips and the medium size hooks, they fit and stay perfectly in my ear, although the hooks are still slightly uncomfortable, but I suspect it'll be fine after some getting used to them after a while.I've basically ended up living with these on, listening to stuff all the time!"
3	:	"Update: Aukey contacted me and sent me a new unit which has better BT reception so I've increased my rating by 1 (good customer service!). Sound quality still middling but basically what you'd expect in this price range.// Original ReviewPros: magnetic ear buds, lightweight, battery life, a few buttons for controls...Cons: random drop outs if I touch my phone, which I don't get with my other earbuds.I bought these based on the reviews that said these had decent sound quality.Welp, I have no idea what kind of ears people have but these aren't any better than the other sub $30 options out there in terms of actual sound quality.Mids and bass are a muddy mess.  None of the EQ options sound good, although the ""bass"" mode does add muddy boom that you can feel if you are into that sort of thing. I'm currently using the ""treble"" option as it seems to have a slight cut in the very muddy mids, but still leaves a heavy muddy bass.  Overall sound quality is like listening to music through a blanket.I'm not saying these are garbage (remember the stock ipod headphones from the early ipods?) but they're not grape either.  Any decent wired headphones beat these by a mile.2 Stars because these are way over-hyped, but still functional.If you actually care about sound quality, move on to a higher price bracket.  The Anker model I tried in the same price range is even worse than this, and miles away from a decent wired ""workout"" headset.  I bought the wired JBL reflects for like $30 and they sound acceptable for what they are, and very very much much better than these bluetooth cheapo sets.  Not amazing, but at least not a muddy mess."
5	:	"Despite their claim of 8 hours, for me its around 11-12 hours with constant youtube usage, they sound amazing for how cheap they are, when I was buying my 2nd pair so I could cut the wire permanently, they were as low as 23 dollars if I remember correctly, but even at 30, these are a steal, I carry 2 pairs and have fully wireless freedom to hear anything I want, and ill have a 12 hour charge ready to go when one dies. Id highly recommend these if youre looking to spend on some bluetooth headphones that wont cost you triple digits, Id be hard pressed to find a better pair."
1	:	"I bought two of these, one in red color, another in blue color. They are paired with an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 6S. I have to say, the connection between the device and the phone is extremely unstable, and kips cutting the audio every second, being impossible to use. Is even worse if you for example put your hand over the headphone receiver, the sound just stops immediately due to the connection problem."
5	:	"I'd take off one star because the mic isn't very good, but since I hardly ever make voice calls, meh. The sound quality on this thing is AMAZING for the price. Very much worth it!"
1	:	"Update 2018: The rubber wingtips no longer stay on the can of the speaker. It seems theyve loosened over time. They slide off now and no longer hold. It's so bad I can't even use them while jogging, let alone sprinting. I can NOT recommend these for gym use. You could sit at your desk and use these, but that's not what I bought them for.NOTE: My review does not address fitment issues, as everyone is unique.These are OK. 3.5 is more accurate than a 3, but it's definitely not a 4 star item. The battery life is good. The sound is good. Even bass, treble is fine. I like that it's magnetic, albeit it's not as strong as I thought it'd be. The pouch is a nice touch. I appreciated that.That said, the controls are heavy and it makes the cord slide to that side. Additionally, I felt the controls were too close to the earbud itself, meaning it's higher up the cord/wire than I would've liked."
1	:	"Very disappointed in this purchase. Like many, I read some reviews on the Aukey Bluetooth Wireless Headphones and since I lost my Jaybirds and didn???t want to spend that kind of money again, I thought they would be worth the try. Dead out of the box so charged them fully and then proceeded to pair them with my iPhone. The pairing worked and I used them for an hour and they seemed pretty good. Turned them off and stored them in the pouch that came with them and the next morning went to turn them on and the battery was dead. That seemed strange to me. But being an optimist I just plug them back in ...the light was red, I left them to fully charge for about five hours and then unplugged them (light was green). Grabbed them, put them in the pouch and in my bag and ran off to school. Later that afternoon I went to use them and the battery was dead again!! So frustrating and disappointing. Called the support number we are directed to call on the order details on Amazon. The ???kid??? on the other end of the phone was very hard to understand and didn???t seem to know what he was doing at all. After me repeating over and over again that they won???t hold a charge he finally tells me to return the product for a refund. Well..... I wanted to try a replacement thinking that perhaps I just received a defective pair but apparently that is not an option. Can???t get my refund until they receive my defective set back. I can???t afford to spend another $30 on a hope. Really bad customer service and based on some of the other reviews about the battery not holding a charge I won???t purposefully order another set. Aukey lost their chance to have a satisfied and repeat customer. I had intended to buy these for several members of my family if they turned out to work well. Anyone out there have recommendations for other Bluetooth wireless headphones at a reasonable price point that actually work?"
4	:	"These work great! I wanted some wireless workout headphones, but didn???t want to spend a lot of cash, because I don???t care all that much about sound quality, and I have very small, child-sized ears and didn???t want to deal with returning or exchanging expensive headphones until I found a good fit (my husband???s Beats workout headphones just straight-up won???t fit on my right ear, because my ear canal is like a half-inch too high for the design).I have connected these to both my computer and my Peloton bike. They were easy to connect, worked the first time, and now as soon as I turn them on, they reconnect to the device I???m using. The sound quality isn???t always the best (there is sometimes some static/white noise), but for $26, I am extremely happy with the sound quality for both listening to workout instructions, and just listening to music. They stay put comfortably in my very small ear canals during my spin and barre workouts (I used the smallest set of hooks and pads). They???re really easy to put in - you don???t have to get a tight seal, just kind of twist them so the hooks are secured in your ear, and you???re ready to go. I charged them once and then probably got 8-10 hours of use out of them before they died and needed recharging, which is much longer than I would have expected them to last. The Wirecutter review mentioned that they fell out a lot due to the weight of the cord, but I haven???t had any issues with that at all."
5	:	"I was very skeptical about these at first, but I bought them as burner Bluetooth headphones for my Gym workouts and regular use. I used to own the original Jaybird bluebuds X which I bought almost 2 yrs ago and then a few days back they died on me, Jaybird was kind enough to give me a one time upgrade to Jaybird Freedoms which was lovely. Anyways, my point is HOLY COW these headphones blew me away. They are as comparable to my Jaybird Bluebuds X or my current pair of Jaybird Freedom but at a fraction of the price. I will be buying more pairs as gifts for friends and family. Kudos Aukey!"
1	:	Headphones are fairly comfortable for the price rangeIt comes with several ear plug sizes for best fitSound is okayIt???s not difficult to like this product but quality is subparStop working after 35 daysI created a ticket reporting the problem in the manufacturer websiteWaiting for an answer1 star until proper feedback ( so far only an email with the ticket nr )
5	:	"Update: A few weeks ago I left a brief 3 star review of this product (below) accepted that I have weird shaped that would not accept these earbuds, put the headphones in the clutter drawer in the kitchen, and forgot about them. Not too long after I received (noticed and opened)  an email from the seller, offering me a different set of foam covers for free to rectify my (!) problem under their warranty and offered a refund.I sat on that e-mail for a bit trying to find the caveat then weighing the offer against my moral grounds but since I really wanted a pair of Bluetooth headphones, asked them to, yes, please send me a different set of earbud covers. The next morning I received a refund for the earbuds and an e-mail asking me to keep my headphones and wait for the new earbud covers. Pretty amazing.I highly appreciate a company that wants to build a lasting reputation.Comes with 3 sizes of silicon covers. Still I can't make them stay in my ear for a walk."
3	:	"Ok, i was so excited to try these out because I hate how my chorded earburds get tangled and move around when I ride my bike. The price is right, good reviews, etc. Got these fast enough, charged them, and out I was....all my excitement was dulled by the fact that the sound or bluetooth connectivity gets dropped and dropped like crazy!!! What the hell! I've owned my fair share of cheap bluetooth speakers/adaptors and I've never hsd the amount of drop these have! I mean, they sound suprisingly good, the EQ's are usable, the controls are good, the earbuds are confortable and come with extra earpieces.So far I'm not impressed at all...but at this price point I'm not surprised...bluetooth connection is bad. And the phone is not even that far apart...i mean, it's in my bag pocket (bike jersey)."
1	:	"After paying $30 for headphones i expect them to at least last a year. I didn't use the Aukey as my primary headphone. I perhaps used it 1-3x a week for maybe 1 hour max when i worked out. Now headphones have died and cannot be recognized by other bluetooth machines. This headphone originally did the job, sound was decent, although the button system didn't make very much sense: (double clicks to change the EQ, why is that necessary?). When you would also turn down the volume all the way down, the EQ was change as a result, that doesn't make sense either. Luckily there is a 24 month warranty which I will claim. That being said going forward I would not recommend spending $30 on these very cheaply made bluetooth headphones, spend the extra to go after a legit brand."
5	:	"update 11/28:from 4 to 5 Stars (can we add another star please? it felt short the first 5): my original review was based on a Huawei AN-LX3 and now i was just testing with an iphone xs max. After testing the EQ on the Music App and Spotify App it was amazing! beyond every expectation i had, every ""bad thing"" this product have with the Huawei was suddenly GONE with the iphone! No stuttering, no connection lost for over 10 feet, beyond amazing sound quality for the price... i mean, i dunno how is this possible but it is! So, if you have an iphone xs max like me, buy it without hesitation!Original review:So, i bought these based on the newer reviews with a ""background check"" of the older reviews and bad reviews... and i'm kinda happy but frustrated at the same time and here's why: I'm beyond obsessed for audio quality that i can't even describe... and when i paired it with my AN-LX3 Huawei (currently, iPhone not tested yet, but incoming) the first music i played the bass was too much, at the point it almost overshadows the other frequencies (by the way, the pairing was a bliss, no issues but more of that below) but then i read the manual and saw that there were 3 EQ's: Bass-oriented, Middle-oriented and Hi-oriented equalizations.Going to the 3 of them: The bass-orientation was an almost impossible to endure, the middle-orientation was too hollow to hear any relevant details of your beloved music and then the sun came up the hill and shined the village: the trebble-orientated equalization was the most balanced between of them. Be aware that these can be changed by pressing 2 times short the multi-function button.Now we're talking! then I started to re-equalize my smartphone (remember that every headphone must be customized in EQ in order to get the most of your music and headphone) because some details were kinda lost in the high and middle-high frequencies. But then again, lows and mid-lows were a bliss! i almost didn't touch them. I didn't talk about mids by itself because they were present but not over or underwhelming, they were just fine for the price.And now the ""sad"" part: I saw other customers had bluetooth connection issues... I usually don't (and didn't for a quite while) have these kind of issues but i was sadly surprised that i started to feel the stuttering and connection lost for a second or 2 then it came back like nothing happened but i also realized that the more i move my smartphone from my pocket to my backpack (for both  cases in the left side since i'm left-handed, the buttons are on the left side, that's a plus for us left-handed people! :D ) the more i started to feel the lost connection between my smartphone and the headphone.I kinda have tracked issues with my smartphone bluetooth signaling, but it makes me doubt where the issues lies: in the smartphone or the bluetooth hearphone. Nevertheless, when fully equalized both THEY SOUND AMAZING! 80% of noise isolation with good volume, but don't go with 100% of volume, it kinda tend to saturate some mid-hi and hi frequencies and that's not good for your beloved ears; find a good volume that doesn't overwhelm your ears and you're good to go!BTW: my iphone is coming, so, i don't have experience with this product with iphones, so i'll let you know how it goes with it since iphone bluetooth are more stable somehow."
4	:	"These are great.  I thought I would loath using Bluetooth headphones, but I really enjoy it.  Design is simple and inoffensive in all black.  The buds magnetically stick together when not in use.  The cord it useful mainly because if I need to take them out of my ears I can just let them dangle from my neck rather than taking out a case or jamming them in my pocket to get tangled.Base is punchy.  Vocals could be clearer, but aren't terribly muddled.  Decent for the most part.Once paired the AUKEY Latitudes are really convenient and easy to use.  The center button is oblong and easy to identify without looking.I use them on my commute everyday, but I ran a block and the damn left earbud fell out due to the weight of the controls and mic on the left.  Would not use for running, but otherwise a great alternative to $100+ Bluetooth earbuds."
4	:	"The AUKEY Latitude Wireless Bluetooth HeadphonesLatitude Wireless Bluetooth Headphones are an excellent buy for the money. They have a good ""bass-y"" sound even on the normal EQ setting. I am pleased with the sound quality, and as headphones, these are very good.The battery on these - I believe - is really tiny and fits in the part where the buttons are (which is also where the recharging port is). I mention this because I have found the life of these to be outstanding. They are rated for 8 hours, but since I never get the chance to listen that long at one time, I will say that I only have to charge them every 2-3 days.  The battery level for the headset shows in the Bluetooth menu on my phone, which is quite handy and something no other Bluetooth headset I have had does. I assume it is a feature of Bluetooth 4.1.I did take off one star for a couple of reasons. The first is that as headphones, these are very good. As a headset (i.e., using the microphone) for conference calls, the microphone picks up way too much surrounding noise. I have to mute myself on conference calls because the other participants find all the ambient noise from my mic too annoying. I never had that complaint before these. I've gone back to using my mono headset with boom mic for conference calls, which means I'm carrying two headsets (albeit small ones). The second issue is that the steps in the volume setting need to be more granular. I find myself using bouncing between two settings the first of which is too quiet and the next step up, which is too loud."
5	:	"Perfect value for the price. I use it with my PC, and it works flawlessly.If you would like to use this product with a PC, make sure you have a strong Bluetooth chip installed. Mine was integrated with the wireless adapter, and I had to connect the antenna that came with the card to get the headphones to work with it.Battery life is OK. Being lightweight, not slippery in-ear and loud enough are my top features."
2	:	"After going through so many different low-cost earbuds, I really wanted these to last. They are so comfortable - light-weight, fit great in my ear, no movement at all with running or working out. Battery life, up to the end, was great. After about two months, the first pair started just disconnecting and then powering off. After a few days of back and forth with the company, I was sent a replacement. Unfortunately these just plain stopped working after two wears. Customer service is great and loved them when they worked. Up to you if you want to play the odds."
5	:	"My ""go to"" headphones for several years have been Bose SoundSports. Maybe it's not fair to compare the Aukeys to the Bose because of the price difference ($30 vs $150), but doing so makes the Aukeys look like a real bargain. Here's how I compare the two:Durability/Quality- I have only owned the Aukeys for a month, so the verdict is still out on how long they'll last, but the materials and construction are on par with the Bose. If anything, the Aukey controls seem to work with less effort than those on the Bose. I'll add that I had to replace my first Bose after a year or so because the controls became unresponsive.  They basically wore out. I like how the earbuds on the Aukey are magnetized, so they can be attached like a necklace around your neck to keep them from being lost. Also, the Aukey earbuds seem to fit more tightly that the Bose earbuds, but that might be because of the shape of my ears.Price- No comparison. $30 vs $150.Sound Quality- Again, no comparison. The sound quality of the Bose is significantly better than that of the Aukey. The Aukeys also have an EQ adjustment (vocals, treble, or bass) that I don't care for, but some uses might prefer. The Bose are my clear choice when I'm in an environment where I can hear and appreciate the full range of the music I'm enjoying (gym, relaxing). I reach for the Aukeys when I'm listening to audiobooks and when I'm listening to music as ""background noise"" (mowing, working around the house).In conclusion, I think the Aukeys are great headphones at any price, but especially at $30."
5	:	"Update 2: Aukey has wonderful customer service and as such has replaced my defective pair of headphone. I would definitely buy again from this brand.Update: After about 2 months with the headphones I have to deduct 2 stars from my original 5 star review. While they still work fine, manufacturing errors are starting to appear. The little grill inside of the headphone (visible when the silicone tip is off) has fallen out and left the hole wide open. I managed to place it back in but it is obvious that it will fall again at some point. I just hope it's not inside my ear (it would be small enough to get lodged inside and perhaps cause damage).  It's a shame. I really liked these.Original review:These are as good as the other reviews claim. Audio is not as good as wired headphones but that is to be expected.  The category that really elevates these headphones is the battery life. These last me about 12 hours of continuous use. I've fallen asleep with these on and paired to my phone and when I wake up they still have a few hours left in them. Furthermore, upon first getting these I tested them I played nonstop music from 4pm to 3:30am and they still had a bit of battery in them when I woke up in the morning. These really are a great buy. I hope they last me a long time and will update accordingly if anything where to happen."
4	:	"I needed something to use on walks to listen to music and audiobooks.  This definitely does the job.  They're so cheap you don't worry too much about losing them although they nicely attach to each other with magnets.Sound Quality (B-)You get what you pay for. The sound is very flat. It does have decent punch to the lows but the highs and mids are far from sharp.  The volume can also get pretty loud.Battery life (A)On one charge it lasted about 3 days of pretty good off and on use.Comfort (C+)All ears are different so this my personal taste. I used a different adapter for the ear since I hated the attachment they give you. The plastic is rather stiff and doesn't take shape in your ear canal. Again, for the price you get what you pay for.Bluetooth (A)This is really the reason to get these. For the price point they work great. The signal is rather strong. I can walk around my place while the phone charges and take calls just fine. It also connects rather quickly to your phone and other devises."
5	:	"TLDR: Great headphones for exercise and general use. These headphones are great up to the point that I lose or destroy them do to my own doing. I've bought 4 pairs so far and keep recommending them. First off, they are far more sweat proof than other headphones that I have owned, which claim to be, so excellent for running, biking, etc... The sound is decent, great for the price. Plenty of bass for harder workout songs, higher range is sometimes lacking. Battery life is about as stated or better, easily lasting through 1 - 2 days of work and commute with frequent use. Unsurprisingly, the battery didn't hold up to well to me repeatedly leaving them in the car during the Michigan winter, which permanently cut my battery life down to about 4-5 hours of play on my first set of headphones. Bluetooth connectivity is quite solid with a Pixel 2 XL, Moto X4, and Google home speakers, but had some issues with Nexus 6p, which leads me to conclude it's probably not an issue with the headphones, but worth considering before you purchase. Overall: Would highly recommend for anyone who is not an audiophile and has a decent Bluetooth streaming device.. Thanks!"
2	:	"Maybe I have a bum unit, but this thing loses battery power after a couple podcast episodes, not after 8 hours. Also, it trips out when a phone call comes through while I'm listening. At first, the caller can hear me, then the line goes cellphone ca 1998 and we are saying CAN YOU HEAR ME?! over and over. I bought this because Wirecutter said it was a great device at a great price, but I don't want to pay anything for a headache."
5	:	"So far these are one of the best quality bluetooth headsets I have tried. I accidently spilled coffee on them this morning, was able to take the earbuds off, and clean them with a damp paper towel and they work fine! I listen to audiobooks working and driving, you do get approximately 8 hours of constant use, and (if you remember to turn it off in between uses) you can get 3-4 days if you only use it on your commute to and from work. (I have roughly a 1 hour commute, and didn't have to charge it for 3 days). The sound is very clear. When I first turn them on, there is some static sound, but music and audiobooks are very clear. The earbuds are also extremely comfortable, I was worried about the addition of the ""hook"" feature into the upper ear, but I love it!  I look forward to using these and will buy this brand in the future if needed."
4	:	These work pretty well. Sound is great and they stay in my ears very snuggly even at the gym.One thing that is annoying though is that when the battery gets a little lower it starts to diminish the bluetooth signal(it seems). I noticed when I was out in our yard doing some work that it would cut out every time my hand passed between my phone and the headset as I walked.I charged the headset and the next time I went out into the yard I did not have any issues.
4	:	"Update, Aukey emailed and provided me with solutions to get the buds to pair with my s9+. After a few trys I was able to pair them. They as expected, not amazing sound but not some dollar junk headphones. Decent bass and good vocals. They stay in my ear great when running and working out, plus no wire to get stuck on weights or ripped out during a set."
4	:	"These headphones are a good deal considering how well they work. I've been using them with my iPhone 6S + and a couple of Windows 7 PCs. They get over 10 hours of battery life with my devices. The buttons on the headphones are able to perform a good number of tasks considering that there are only three of them. Make sure to keep the hard copy of the manual or scan it right away, because...My only complaint with this product is that you can't find an electronic copy of the user manual anywhere on the internet (try searching ""ep-b40.pdf"", you won't find it anywhere). This appears to be the case with most Aukey products, at least their headphones. However, after contacting Aukey I was able to obtain the manual from their support via email. You'll have to do the same since Amazon won't let me put the URL in this review; just know that it is obtainable by emailing support."
2	:	"The good: No trouble connecting these to bluetooth on my Samsung phone. Decent sound.The bad: Could not find a combination of ear hooks and tips that will stay in my ears during running. The weight of the controller on the left side especially drags the earbud out of my left ear. I guess ear hooks are just not for me, I could not stand the feeling of the point pressing into my skull. Maybe there is some trick to getting a secure and comfortable fit, but these earbuds come with no fit instructions in the box and the website is no better."
3	:	"I have not checked the battery lifetime on it - but it works fine, stays in my ears and has okay sound.I do not like:- How it sticks out of my ears, definitely not cosmetic- The light on the controller flashes a lot and is very bright - grabs other people's attention and my own which is annoyingBottom line: if it was free to return, I would have returned it!"
3	:	"The wireless headphones at first seemed like they would fit my needs. Sound quality was fine for the cost and seemed sturdy enough. However, could not get any of the supplied bud covers to fit in my ear. The ones shipped with the unit were way too big. The small replacement covers sort of fit my ears, however, because they were so much smaller they did not provide any cushioning and were very uncomfortable for me. That may not be a design flaw, it might just be my ears are very small inside. The reason I had to return, however, was because I could not get them to keep a charge. The first time my play time was less than 2 hours after I gave them a full charge. The second time I attempted to charge them, no matter how long I charged them, they would loose the charge immediately upon being disconnect from the charger. I was somewhat sad to return them because for the short while that they worked they were nice. I feel that perhaps my pair was defective due to the charging issue, so if you order them you may have a different experience. The one question I sent to customer service was answered in a very short amount of time. I would give them 5 stars for that interaction."
3	:	"These earbuds were fine besides one issue: the minimum volume was far too loud. Anything above one or two volume bars was almost unbearable. This was with my iPhone 6S, I also tried them with a Galaxy S7 Edge and did not experience this issue. I contacted Aukey support about this, and after what seemed like a not very in depth attempt to solve the problem they offered me a 20% refund. I decided to just return them and get a 100% refund. I now have the Sony WI-C300s which I am very happy with.UPDATE: Aukey contacted me in response to this review and sent a replacement pair of earbuds. I'm still using the Sony WI-C300s because I like them better, but the replacement earbuds from Aukey do have a better volume range."
4	:	"I bought them based on a review on ""Wirecutter"".Paired immediately with iPhone X and Apple Watch series 1. Maintained connection with phone over a distance of 25 feet before breaking it. Watch was another story, connection breaks off easily when the watch is on the left hand and headphone controller side is on the right hand side. The problem is with the headphones. I have other wireless earphones and they do not have this problem. The silicone buds are very thin and flimsy, they do not sit comfortably in the ear canal.Sound is at par with the price."
3	:	"These sound great and the magnet is cool.  My only complaint is the cord is a little bit too long, so it tends to stick to the back of your neck and pull on one side or the other (especially when hot/sweaty)... Very uncomfortable and annoying."
4	:	"I am really enjoying these headphones. They sound good, pair easily, stay put in my ears and are water resistant. I use them for when I take walks. The sound quality is good, not great, but that is fine, I am out for a walk, not listening critically in a quiet environment. I have not used them to make a call, not sure I ever will, so I can't say how good they are for that.Keep in mind, I am certainly including the low price in my overall rating, I would expect more from something costing 6 times as much. Having paid as little as I did, I am absolutely delighted with the purchase."
5	:	"Like many of you, I have searched year after year for the perfect headphones for physical activity. I have tried dozens of versions of the in-ear type of wireless headphones. Bose is garbage. Beats and Apple too. They all are extremely overpriced. But being overpriced doesn't make them crap. It's the little things. Battery life. Usability. Fit. Connectivity. Sound quality. None of these compared to what I thought was the best balance between them.So I ended up with the Jaybird X series. First the X, then the X2, and recently the X3.I loved the sound quality the most. Fit and usability far ahead of the rest of the pack, especially since they started including the memory foam tips with the X3 series.All of this is echoed on review sites like the wirecutter dot com and here on Amazon.But then Player 2 entered the game!If I didn't know any better, I would have sworn these buds were made by Jaybird.Same exceptional sound quality and fit, but with FAR BETTER connectivity, and none of the irritations of the Jaybird, like the proprietary charger connection, the super annoying announcements THAT YOU CANNOT TURN OFF (headphones connected! Battery life 60 percent!)I had been using the Jaybird series for so long that it had just become second nature to me and i didn't realize just how annoying it is.Especially considering what these type of earphones are typically used for, and that is any activity that you want to isolate all outside sounds from. Working out, running, yard work, whatever, you just  want to hear the music or podcast or Netflix, and be interrupted at random with ""HEADPHONES CONNECTED!""Now I can't speak to overall longevity as I've only had these for a few weeks, but I can speak to the Jaybirds longevity, which if you read reviews on them, you'll see is almost comically consistent at about a year. Sure enough, as I look through my Amazon order history, there they are, at about the same time every year, the Jaybirds.Here's the bottom line: if you also like the Jaybirds better than Beats, Bose, Apple, or pretty much any of the other popular brands at a similar price point, the Aukeys are a far better buy. There is nothing the Jaybirds do that is better than the Aukeys, and several things the Aukeys have an advantage at. Such as the standard micro USB charging port, magnetic end caps, far better connectivity, and a price that is worth it, even just to try.Frankly, they could charge much higher prices than they currently do for these and I would pay it.  Even if these don't last half as long, I would still have paid less than half for a better product and experience.BTW, the physical layout and control scheme is identical to the Jaybirds, so you don't have to learn any new commands.  Again, I swear these were made by Jaybird, but they just stole all the good things about the Jaybirds, fixed or removed the problems, and added subtle but marked improvements.Here's hoping Jaybird reads this review and makes their next series better."
4	:	"I really liked these headphones for the week that they were working.  Comfortable to wear, stayed put during workouts, paired easily every time, controls worked well, battery lasted a long time, they sounded great in all of the different EQ modes.  However, after the first week the left earbud stopped working.  I have contacted customer support so hopefully they can remedy the situation.  I'll try to update this review later.Update 1: I emailed customer service and within 24 hours received a response that they would send me a new pair.  So they have very good customer service.  Hopefully the new pair will work properly this time.Update 2:  The replacement headphones arrived within a week (and I didn't have to send back the broken ones).  They work great and so I'm changing my review to 4 stars because I'm currently very happy with the working set of headphones.  The cord and control buttons are a little heavy compared to some other pairs I've seen people wearing at the gym, but for this price I think they are great."
3	:	"It comes with a set of ear hooks and ear buds to adjust it (small, medium, large). Well it's suppose to come in pairs, but I was missing a piece... Instead of another small ear bud to make it a pair, I got similarly sized... piece of random plastic.... What the heck. Didn't think it would matter, but that's actually the size I need.The sound is okay, comparing them to similarly priced Apple headphones (wired) they are on par. Apple ones are better though, more balanced (these are more high and very little low), it has poor sound range, and these have a much thinner sound (that is it isn't full). But acceptable for the price.They are comfortable, they hold up well... for the side that I have the right sizes in, but unfortunately I'm missing the small buds for the other ear, so that side falls out.The mic quality mattered to me too, it's ok... Don't expect much if outside or around noise. In a quiet indoor room, it's fine. Again compared to Apple wired headphones, the apple ones are better. But those are not wireless.Overall everything was as I expected and ok, nothing that impressive. It's the price that really sells it for me. Would be 4 stars if I actually got all the parts (since it slips out frequently on the side I don't have the right earbud part for)."
5	:	"I use these around the yard and when walking.  Fits well in my ears, sound quality is good, easy to use.  Surprised at some of the less favorable reviews as these are just as described and a very good buy for the price.  No there won't our perform a Bose product for sound quality but also are half as much.  If you are looking for a headphone that will have some durability, good sound, and not break the bank, I would consider this product."
1	:	"Ok, maybe static isn't better, but at least the static is constant unlike these headphones that beeps and cuts off the frequency to the music.Ordered on May 14, 2018.It is now Oct. 2018.When the headphones were delivered, I didn't immediately use them. I bought them so I could run without a cord bouncing below my face.I think after two months of use (it didn't get too much use until July), the beeping sound became more frequent than usual. The beeping sound is a warning that your battery is low.Well, the beeping sound evolved to beep constantly takes be back to the good old days of listening to scratched CDs with commitment and denying myself to buy it again because I don't need TWO Chumbawamba CD cases! Then, later, tell myself that if I another Chumbawamba album, I'll end up saving the extra CD case after downloading from Kazaa, The Game's new album, ""The Documentary,"" to burn to a CD.........Uh, where was I?  The frequency is constantly cut off and the beeping sound is incessant. By the way, the battery is charged and I'm not out of range when it happens.-----Sound Quality:My opinion comes from really liking the sounds of Apple headphones and using my boyfriend's Beat headphones. So, AUKEY headphones, in comparison, have a similar sound quality to Apple headphones.  And I am happy about that.  AUKEY pales in comparison to the BEAT product.Dear AUKEY,If you're reading this, I want to let you know that I am super smad (sad and mad)."
5	:	"I wanted a pair of headphones I can wear during my commute and not have to worry about damaging or losing them, these are great. They feel comfortable in the ear (I took off the little 'wing' attachment) and stay on pretty well. The magnet helps to keep the earbuds together around the neck if you're not using them, and they're quite easy to pair to new devices and to switch devices as well.A friend got the exact same pair around the same time (3-4 months ago) and one of the 'wing' attachment (the little T shaped thing that helps to secure the earbuds in your ear) has already broken off. If you're not using those to begin with (like me), these headphones are holding up great.I've worn them in light rain and have never worried about them breaking."
5	:	"I use this product for the gym and occasionally for phone calls. The three EQ settings are really nice option. Sometimes voice quality on phone calls is not the absolute best but it is serviceable. Sound quality with playing music is quite good. Things I really love include how well it stays in my ears even while working out at the gym, the tremendously greater flexibility it gives me and movement while working out, the soft-touch rubber for the ears is very comfortable, it connects lightning-quick to my phone via Bluetooth... the button functionality is intuitive and useful... And the signal lights colors are fairly easy to interpret... also the pouch that it comes in is very useful to protect the earphones and the open close mechanism for the pouch is quite Nifty And easy-to-use. I also like the stickers that it comes list to place on the couch. It gives it a very unique and stylish Flair. And makes it easy identifiable when out and about."
5	:	"Pairing was easy. The headphones work and once I switched to a smaller earbud it was more comfortable. Problem is that I got these so I could wear them while figure skating with easier music control. They stay in while I???m doing general foot work and jumps. But it frequently goes flying out during spins. It???ll probably be fine for runners or general work out uses. Just don???t spin fast with it.** update originally 3 stars **Okay. This company???s customer service is amazing. They reached out and sent me a different type of headphones to try to address the problem. New ones have a neck piece so the headphones don???t fly during a spin. (The ear buds are a worse fit tho, so those come off instead, but at least I don???t have to run across ice to retrieve flying headphones.) 2 stars returned Bc their customer service was amazing."
5	:	"Short and to the point.How the h*ll did this company produce, for a such a  low price,  a truly exceptional ( exceptional means bass that rivals $100+ wireless buds ???clean, tight and resonating- excellent balance of midrange and crisp high end with nothing missing on all genres of music deep house, hip hop, all jazz, rock, classical & more) Built in equalizer: a quick double click on the button and change the EQ for voice, strong bass, and level flat. Battery life is excellent. Earbud design with ear piece design keeps it in place even while exercising. Magnets in ear piece keep it neatlyTogether in the ???squeeze open??? case.Get these and be happy."
5	:	"Good bass and battery life is solid also but fit for me was not good so i ended up selling to a coworker.The taotronics i own fit me better and the sound is bit more balanced in the mids but i still see the Aukey as a great buy.Pros:- Great sound just not as balanced as other devices but Bass is nice and full- Battery life is about 8 hours so good on that promise- Buttons are clicky and kinda soft (love that compared to the Taotronics hard button's)Cons,- No voice prompts,- When battery low warning comes on it cuts off a few minutes after and it should say low battery not beep.- Fit for me and wings not so comfortable- Cord was a  bit shorter than my Taotronics which i find has a limited cord also."
5	:	"Let me start by saying this is the first review I have ever left on Amazon.  These earbuds are amazing!  I use them for cycling rides and they definitely stay put in the perfect position for sound quality.I was very hesitant to make the switch to wireless (just another thing to charge), but my current phone (moto z force) does not have a headphone jack.  I have tried the adapters but they are junk, they wear out in a couple of weeks.  I can say that I am happy my phone does not have a headphone jack, otherwise I would not have had the chance to experience these ear buds!I go on 100+ mile cycling rides, and they stay comfortable the whole time.  I have always been a fan of aukey, but i have to say, they knocked it out of the park with this one!  Comfortable, tremendously excellent sound quality, and fairly inexpensive!I have been so impressed I just ordered another pair to keep at my apartment, while I keep the other with me at work/play.Thanks AUKEY!  You have a customer for life, and to anyone looking at the buds, why are you still reading this?  Just buy them, you wont regret it."
5	:	"I like on a horse farm and spend a lot of time on tractors and mowers.  I listen to Pandora on my phone or music on a MP3 player.  I have always used corded eat buds inside sound suppressing ear muffs.  THe cord has always been a nuisance.  I have tried several sound cancelling headsets with blue tooth.  None work, the equipment noise is just too loud.  I have never wanted to spend several hundred dollars for Bose.  Other blue tooth earphones are just too large to fit inside my sound suppressing muffs.  These are just about perfect.  They are small enough to fit inside the muffs.  They are comfortable and fit my ears quickly.  The battery life is adequate.  The price is right.No perfect but do the job."
5	:	"I???m so stoked on these. I had purchased three different brands of Bluetooth earbuds (including a $200 pair from Bose) and these blow them all out of the water!! The charge life lasts at least 8 hours...maybe more, but I???ve never needed longer so I???m not sure. I landscape all day and use loud machines and blowers. I pop these in and listen to podcasts for hours without issue. The microphone seems to work great, as well, as I???ve had several phone conversations with great success and no complaints. The earpieces are adjustable and super comfortable. I can???t do the Apple earbuds because they make my ears ache. 8 hours with these suckers in and no problems. I???m debating buying a couple extra pairs just to have as backup if and when these ever die/get lost/break. Absolutely worth the $30 I spent. Best Bluetooth speakers I???ve over used!"
1	:	"I got sucked in by the positive reviews for earbuds that cost less than half of the ones I was going to buy. That was a mistake. These sound awful. I use them to play games on my Pixel 2 XL...the sound is very hollow. Not much bass, not much treble. It sounds like I'm listening in a cave. They fit nicely, but the sound is very poor. I will see if I can return these.Update: Dropping to one star. The battery hasn't lasted more than 4 hours on a full charge, in contrast to claims of 8 hours of battery life, and today in the gym after 30 minutes of use, they dropped the Bluetooth connection and won't reconnect. I want my money back."
2	:	"Everything about this product is pretty good for the price, except the bluetooth range which essentially makes everything else not matter.It cuts in and out when I have my phone in my pocket. I'm not a super tall guy or anything, its literally less than 3 feet away my phone and starts to cut in and out so obnoxiously its unusable. I have to put my phone in my breast pocket (if my outfit has one that day).If you want to use it for exercise, whether or not its usable depends on the exercise. For example, if you're running and have your phone or device in your armband, should be fine. In your pocket, probably not. I use a flipbelt where I keep my phone low on my back which works OK, but if it slides down at all, it cuts out.Maybe its just mine and your mileage may very, but for me its loses most of its value based on its range being so short.**********Update***************AUKEY refunded my money and sent me a new pair of headphones. However, the new pair had the exact same issue. Great service. That being said, while I can recommend the company, I still can't recommend the headphones."
5	:	"So I just got these and my initial review is that they are WAY better than BeatsX. A little background. I just upgraded to the Iphone 8 which required me to get wireless headphones b/c thanks Apple. I got a pair of BeatsX thinking that Apple would make a great product since they are partnered with Beats now. My biggest concern with earbuds is will they actually stay in my ear when I'm running/working out. The BeatsX were mostly a failure all around for this. These Aukey earbuds on the other hand fit snugly in my ear. I did a lot of extra shaking to test out how much they would move. They completely passed. Movement was minor, and I did not have to press the earbud back into my ear. After I changed the tips, I got an even better fit.After that, they are also louder than the BeatsX too. I know loud noises can damage your ears, but I like hearing my music when I run verse constantly trying to hear my music over the surroundings. When you throw in the fact that these are about $30 compared with all the $100-$150 earbuds out right, these earbuds are a steal. SO happy with these right now."
5	:	"I???m so excited to have found a pair of ear buds for my tiny ears. If you didn???t know, these are also the wirecutter???s ???budget pick??? for the best wireless buds.The little hooks for the ear are awesome! They keep these in my ear nice and tight and I don???t experience them slipping out like I do with other buds.I also like magnetic feature that keeps them around my neck when not in my ears."
3	:	"EDIT 11/5/18: Aukey contacted me not long after my initial review offering to refund my purchase and send a new pair  to try. I have not had the chance to try the replacement pair, but I was blown away by the customer service response. For that reason I have increased my rating to 3-stars, pending further testing of the replacement unit.----I really wanted to like these headphones. They weigh practically nothing and as advertised, i've been getting 6-8 hours from each charge. I appreciated the multiple ear piece options, which provided a rudimentary level of customization. Pairing to my phone and computer was nearly instantaneous. I was even pleasantly surprised when I found out the headphones could connect to 2 devices simultaneously, albeit with awkward clipping of whatever music i'm listening to as it alternates between sound sources.However...The sound quality is terrible. The bass is anemic at best, but mostly just entirely missing. If you crank the volume above ~30%, the treble distortion verges on unbearable. I understand that these headphones are meant to be used while exercising, during which the user probably cares less about sound quality than they do comfort and fit. It could also just be the pair I received. However, at this point I cannot recommend these headphones to anyone who even remotely cares about sound quality."
2	:	"I don???t know whose ears these are design for but they keep falling out. I???ve used the Wired Bose earbuds for years that had the ear insert and always worked. These Aukey just fit poorly at all sizes, probably designed for tiny ears in country of manufacture. Problem with everything made overseas now a days. Price was 2/3 discount with lightning deal, but useless since they keep falling out."
1	:	"These headphones worked great, once a week, for a little over a month. Unfortunately, my return window closed and ....they died.  No warning, no battery flashing light, no sounds to indicate anything was about to happen.  Just dead. So needless to say I am disappointed. While they were not awfully expensive, I did put time and thought into which headphones to buy, and I do expect more than 5 hours of going to the gym from a $25 pair of headphones."
4	:	"I bought these mainly for my commute but they're so comfortable I now use them instead of my over-the-ear wired headphones at work quite a bit.  The sound is great overall, maybe a little shy on the bass but I prefer that to being overly bassy and boomy.  The one downside which I'd read in reviews was that the cord between the earbuds was too long -- this must have been an updated model, as the cable is a comfortable length and comes with a little plastic clip to allow you to clip the cable to itself thus making it even less likely to dangle.  My only complaint is the charging port cover, which doesn't rotate and so needs to be pushed way back to connect the charging cable... I suspect this will break at some point due to needing to manhandle it like that."
5	:	These work great. You cannot beat the price if you are looking for a decent all around wireless headphones. Battery life last almost a whole week for me with being in the gym everyday and always listening to music. The ends are magnetic to each other which is great to prevent cable entanglements.  Are these going to sound as nice as a $100 pair of headphones? No of course not but for $30 you cannot go wrong and if I ever break or loose them I wont' cry over $30 vs a bose headset.
5	:	"Very Satisfied with this order, I usually listen to audiobooks on my nano when I workout and I was always have the wired earbuds falling out or yanked out during my routines.  It took me about 30 sec to connect my ipod to the the Aukeys and after that no issues, they stayed in my ears, the sound quality is excellent, I could still hear things around me but it did not interfere with my listening.  Fort the price these are an excellent bargain, there are probably better sounding Bluetooth earbuds for a lot more money, but for what I wanted and needed, they are fantastic.  Very happy with this order, would highly recommend."
4	:	"Got these on sale for $10, and at that price, these are awesome. Battery lasts as long as advertised and sound really isn't too bad for a pair of Bluetooth headphones this cheap and they are fairly comfortable. Bluetooth connection is generally good, though I do get a lot of skips if I put my phone in my back pocket. I thought this was weird as I can walk across a room and even behind a wall without losing a connection. The controls on the one side also tend to pull the cord over to one side of my head when running. Still, these have performed great at about 1/10 the price I was originally thinking of spending on j-birds or something."
4	:	"I bought these to use with Apple Watch Series 4 LTE for workouts when I don't have my phone close. I do a lot of outdoor exercises(Running, Hiking, Biking etc...) and they have never fallen out. They come with other ear pieces to help fit but the standard ones fit me well. After an hour long workout my ears will be slightly tired of having ear buds in, but that is a large improvement for my ears and ear buds getting along. The sound quality is decent for the price (mid 20s) and they do a great job of blocking out the wind sound without having to crank the volume. Even outside on a windy day I only have the volume at the second setting. They paired very easily with the watch and have never had a problem connecting."
5	:	"I am honestly shocked at how good these headphones are for the price of $28! I use these primarily for video calls. I've been frustrated with $20 ish bluetooth headphones. I've bought a few pairs that were just garbage, terrible sound quality and the mic kept cutting out. In contrast, these sound great! The microphone seems to be very good quality - the person on the other end of the call didn't even realized I'd switched from my wired headphones to these. The audio sounds good too, no static or cutting out. I'm not a super audiophile, but these headphones work perfectly for hands free calling."
5	:	I was looking for a simple Bluetooth headphones that were waterproof for doing 5-10 mile jogs 3 times a week. I didn't want to spend over $100 but I did want something that would function well and not be a total piece of garbage.These little guys fit the bill pretty perfectly. I've had no issues with the Bluetooth disconnecting and I get plenty of workouts with them before I need to recharge the battery (once every 2-3 weeks)
5	:	"These are a pretty amazing value for the money. I've been using my pair pretty heavily for about a month now and love them. The sound quality isn't amazing, as you'd expect for such an inexpensive and compact device, but it's perfectly good for my use--some music, a lot of podcasts and phone calls. I'd say they sound just as good as the Apple earbuds they're replacing.I had to switch to the large rubber cups that came with them to get them to stay snugly in my ears. I love the magnetic backs that stick them together when not in my ears so they stay safely around my neck.They paired easily with my iPhone as well as my MacBook and the range seems very good. The battery lasts through several days of on-and-off use for me, and on my iPhone the icon at the top of the screen even shows the battery level so I have some idea when they're getting low.I'm pretty careful about keeping them in the little pouch they came with, and so far they seem perfectly sturdy to me."
1	:	"Second time buying these headphones. I absolutely loved the first pair. Great quality, great sound, overall an amazing experience. This time around, not so much. The felt cheaper, the sound quality is awful, the left earbud practically doesn???t work. Magnetic ends on the ear buds barely works. Just super dissapointed because I loved and recommended these to everyone the first time around. Don???t know what went wrong but hope for future customers this helps out."
1	:	"I bought these in June of this year. I loved them. The extra EQ bass plus the settings on my Pixel 2 made these sound really good.Sadly, the EQ also crashes constantly and I have to leave it off, kind of defeating the purpose of these earbuds.Constantly while I am listening to music, if I change the EQ setting to bass... at some random point I will hear a loud beep, and the volume turns all the way off. My phone does this with no other earbuds. I also thought it was my phone, as I had just got the Pixel 2.Several months later I finally figured it out. After turning the volume back up, I was noticing the EQ setting was reset. I noticed it would reset before but I assumed it was because I let the earbuds run out of power.No. The stupid things crash, killing the volume, and the EQ settings.Leaving the EQ off the headphones work fine... but sound like crap.Stay away."
3	:	"I bought these for running, which I wouldn???t recommend them for. There was a constant ???wind??? sound and I could hear the wire bouncing on the back of my neck. In the future I???ll probably buy truly wireless earbuds for that.They have been useful for weightlifting and work, though. I liked that they came with different sized ear-pieces. Unfortunately my package came with one of the smaller ear pieces missing, which is the size I need. The larger sized pieces are uncomfortable and pop out of my ears easily. Especially when I sweat.The sound quality is unexpectedly good for the price, I have to say! And there is plenty of battery life."
3	:	"The Aukey earbuds connect with my Pixel 2 easily for the first 2.5 months. Unfortunately, they have stopped connecting completely via bluetooth rendering them unusable.In addition, they never connected with with Macbook Pro from day 1, which was bearable since I could still use them with my phone which no longer the case.Update: Aukey customer service has been incredible. Not only did they resolve the issue by sending me new earbuds, but they refunded the entire order and still followed up to check in.The new earbuds work with my Pixel 2 phone, and I am able to use the earbuds on both devices now (Macbook Pro and Pixel 2). However, I have to factory reset each time to do so and cannot simply un-pair from one device and re-pair to another which is not ideal. I'm hoping it's due to an issue with my 2009 Macbook Pro's bluetooth and will re-try once I get a new Pixelbook this year."
5	:	I have two of these because I liked the first pair so much. They are extremely durable as I put them in the washing machine by accident and they still work no problem. I've never had any problems with the battery life.Biggest con that I can think of is that they tend to still fall out of my ears while exercising. They come with adapters for different ear sizes but I think none of them fit my ears well enough. Connectivity can also be so-so. When I am biking and my phone is in my jersey pouch behind my back the songs can skip occasionally.
5	:	"Great sounding pair of Wireless IEMs, Bass is great for EDM and bassy types of music. The EQ profiles are great for people who like their sound tuned to different preferences.The battery life is as advertised and long enough for me.The cord is slightly long for me because I have a smaller head then average, but other than that most people will find the cord a very sufficient length.However there is one point of potential issue, the charging port flap will eventually fall off due to how it is attached. Instead of twisting in a rotating motion, it comes off bending backwards, eventually the creasing will cause it to fall off.Overall, if you are looking for a decent pair of wireless IEMs to prepare for the trend of removing the 3.5mm jacks, or just like wireless in general this is a good pair of IEMs to have."
4	:	"I got these to listen to audobooks while I'm out walking.So far, I've been very happy with them. They come with three sizes of ear tips and ear hooks, so it is easy to adjust the fit. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is good the volume is sufficient - even for me (two hearing aids). I've used bluetooth adapters for my hearing aids, but i'd rather have something that's significantly less expensive if i get caught in the rain etc. While durability will be tested over time, the build quality seems quite good.The only thing that bothers me (only very slightly) is that I'm having to adapt to having the cord on riding on my neck. I'm just not used to it. It's not painful, just something new that I need to adjust too.I'm not running or engaging in some other rigorous activity while wearing these, so i can't comment on how stable they are, but they seem quite secure."
2	:	"As a quick note: I am using this with a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 phone.I bought the device cause it went on sale, but I didn't really use it. I then realized that I could be bringing these with me while I commute to school, so I did so. However, this was a while after I bought them, so I couldn't return them after I found the biggest issue with them: the range.I don't know why, but the advertised range is awful for these. While walking from my bus to campus, I put my phone in my pocket, and the audio was immediately cutting off, over and over. I took my phone out of my pocket, and it got a bit better. A few days later, I was sitting at a table, with my phone on the table, and the audio was cutting off, over and over. I decided to put my phone near the piece with the buttons, but cover that piece with my hand; the audio began cutting off.I decided to contact customer support, which was very fast and cooperative. They quickly sent me a new pair. However, the new pair had the same issue with range; in fact, the range felt even worse than the original headphones.However, aside from the range issue, the audio quality is quite good.Would've been a 1 star, but I decided to give it two for the customer service and the audio quality."
3	:	"This is my second $30 pair of BT headsets. This one has much better sound than the MPOW cheetahs. I strictly use them for running/stationary bike workouts. Id say they stay in the ears just okay. if the cord hangs in the front, they stay in better, if you position it behind the head, they tend to pull on the earbuds more causing them to want to pull out easier. The reason I dropped the stars is the microphone. Noise cancelling these aint. If you use them for a call in a completely quiet area then they work great but any background noise is very amplified to the extent that if Im in the gym, it really bothers the person on the other end of the line."
5	:	"At that price point, can't really ask for more; have abandoned Bluetooth headset in early Jabra days, when headsets used to be expensive, sound quality was poor, as well as the battery lifetime. Happy to see, that all of the issues with BT headsets were fixed since then - sound quality is on par with my 50-something USD wired headphones (thanks to APT-X, I guess - my smartphone has the APT-X support) and the battery life, when paired to BT5.0 device is close to what was promised, if not better. Not sure, how long they would last, but, can't be happier with the purchase, so far."
5	:	"Sound was a little disappointing. Seems like you are paying for Bluetooth rather than sounds quality. I'd probably rather pay 20-30% more for better sound. Live and learn.UPDATED: The seller was incredibly responsive and sent another pair of headphones for me to try. The sound is better in the second pair. Given the seller responsiveness, I've bumped my review to five stars.You can buy a pair knowing the seller will stand behind them, which is rare these days."
1	:	"I've now gone through two of these. I got one and then complained to their customer support about how bad the bluetooth connection was. They sent a new one, and after a few months of using it and trying to live with it, I've decided to go bad to my old pair of another brand.The biggest issue is that the connection is so bad that it randomly interrupts the sound so much that it's just painful to attempt to listen to music. It doesn't happen all the time, but enough that it's not possible to live with. I know the company tells you to try all these things to prove it's you and not them, but it's them, because I've tried everything and nothing makes it better. Every other bluetooth device I have is fine, except this one.So, my suggestion it to look elsewhere if you want quality, and I know you can get headphones from other vendors at the same price point that actually function well."
1	:	"Bought 1 pair - not even 1 day into running i noticed a soldering issue in the rear control hub wire cause anytime you started jogging or touched the wire, it would cut out or go staticy.Decided to give them a 2nd chance, so sent it back and got a new pair.. sure enough, not even 5 minutes into my run i had to stop cause the same issue - after inspection, this time it was a soldering issue on the right ear bud wire...I dont know whats going on at AUKEY, but they need to step up their soldering/wiring game, this is really sad. I was all ready to give this 5 stars cause the ear buds fit amazing, they don't ever come loose and are very lightweight, it pairs very easily to your smart phone, music (when it works) is crisp and nice, battery life is fantastic and fits any android phone plugin in case you don't wanna use the small cord they give you, and it has a built in mic.Can't ask for more than that in a very reasonably priced headphone.. but all that is for not if they won't even work new out of the box."
5	:	second product of wireless headphone I gotten from them. first one was a older version I got in 2015 that was great but I lost that one couple months ago and decided to get another one from the same company but better version. glad I did. they fit better and quality is much better than the previous one I had. thanks a lot. great headphones
5	:	"I bought these for my husband, and he loves them!  He is very picky about quality of headphones,  This is his 3rd pair, and he is thrilled with these!  It is a bonus you can adjust the EQ on this set.  He loves how snug and comfortable they fit in his ears.  I tried them on and now I am making a purchase for a pair.  You cannot go wrong with these Bluetooth headphones.  I am on my 3rd pair now, & I am so looking forward to having a decent sounding, & super comfortable pair of Bluetooth headphones!  I highly recommend this product!"
5	:	"I love these! Paired successfully on the first try with both my phone and my laptop, no worries there. I'm using the medium size of the little internal earbud covers, and the small size of the little tips that go in front of that little flap where a tragus piercing goes, no issues with fit. I've used them while running, while doing housework, and while sitting in a coffee shop, totally seamless experience. Love the pouch they came in. Sound is good to me, but these are the most expensive listening devices I've ever had, so I am not an expert there."
4	:	"Good product. Works as expected and I really like that it comes with three sizes for my baby ears that are too small for most headphones. The battery life is good and i like the magnet that holds the two earbuds together. Hoping they last a while. The only thing I don???t like/isn???t super user friendly is how long you have to press the middle button to turn them on & off. It???s about 5 seconds compared to 2 seconds for the bose version. I also don???t like the sound it plays in your ears when they turn on/off, and that there is a blinking light on the little plastic part where the volume & on/off keys are which is really annoying since I like to wear these headphones in the dark."
5	:	"I left my $250 B&O Bluetooth headset, similar style, at my retreat and won't be back for months. So I bought these for $25 on an Amazon deal to tide me over till I got my B&Os back. The funny thing is, I actually like these better and here's why.1. Fit, these fit me way better than the B&Os.2. Standard mini-usb connector, no special interface like the B&O.3. Sounds just as good to me as the pricey ones.4. Price, very affordable, no tears if lost.5. Easy to use, intuitive, connects every time."
5	:	"For under $30 this is insane. Great packaging. The materials on the headphones themselves look and feel like the quality of $100 headphones. They pair so easily and quickly. Headphones came with charged battery. Full, clear sound. Bass is clear and not rattly or artificial. Sound range is great. They fit so comfortably. I hate when my ears feel suctioned with cheap seal ear buds. These don't do that. My ears are going to have to adjust to such crisp sound."
5	:	"When I'm working out, I'm not in audiophile mode. I don't need to hear the purest bass and the absolute highest notes. I'm just looking for some background music or maybe a podcast. These earphones deliver great quality and most importantly, are super comfortable and don't fall out. The battery lasts me maybe two weeks of one hour workouts. I will have no problem buying another pair of these if they die on me in a year or whatever. Great value."
5	:	"I found these recommended through The Wirecutter, and have been really happy with them so far. Fast and easy pairing, quick charging, and convenient to store and use. There are magnets in the earbud heads (opposite end from the ear-in side), so these clip together around your neck when you aren't using them. I like that touch. Setup, manual, and design were easy to understand, and the company, Aukey, sent a followup email a few days after delivery to see how I was getting on with the headphones so far."
5	:	"These headphones are great. I purchased these after my previous bluetooth headphones broke. These headphones have a solid blue tooth connection that worked while I walked through doors and other rooms, away from my phone. After a few iterations of trial and error to choose the right tips, I went for a 2 mile run. I did not have to adjust the headset and had great sound the entire time. My previous running headphones would need adjusting after every .3-.5 miles. It was also plenty loud without having to max out the volume."
5	:	"I love these! You can adjust volume without touching your device, can skip forward etc but that takes some practice to figure out. It comes with a great little snap bag and adjustable ear pieces. They stay in place perfectly during rigorous workouts. The control piece does make the wire pile up on one side but it comes with a hook to collect extra wire in the back that helps but it can get lost as it's not attached permanently."
4	:	"These are quite comfortable and the in-ear hooks make them very secure. Noise isolation is decent, the magnets are convenient, and battery life is great. My only major complaint is that if you press the decrease volume button when the headphones are already on the lowest volume setting, this not only mutes the sound but changes the sound profile, so you have to press volume down then volume up twice again to cycle back to your desired eq setting. This is quite annoying given the lowest volume step on the headphones is (imo) already quite loud, so it happens to me a lot. I guess it's a forgivable flaw in otherwise great $25 headphones."
4	:	"I only wear these for working out. So my priorities are that I get headphones that A) stay in place, B) don't get in the way of whatever I'm doing, C) have a battery life of more than like four hours, and D) don't sound terrible. For the price point, these are stellar in all of those regards. No, they don't sound as good as my $100 over-ear Bose headphones, but they filter out the noise around me and aren't distracting while I'm working out. They seem durable so far, although I've only been wearing them for a week or so.Knocked off one star because after about two hours, the wings start to bother my ears a bit. But for the normal amount of time I spend at the gym, these are great."
4	:	"These sound pretty good for the price - they are no match for more expensive headphones, but more than decent. I had several issues that I finally figure out and now they've been working great for a week.1) If they are connected to more than 1 device at the same time, there is stuttering.2) If they are connected to my Macbook Pro (2017) and they are set as both the input and output device, there is stuttering. If I go into the settings and select internal microphone as the input source, they work great.I wish this was documented somewhere in a FAQ, their support was responsive but didn't provide any troubleshooting steps like this."
5	:	"I bought these headphones for my birthday. I wanted wireless ones because I recently got an iPhone 7. I did a lot of research and was trying to find a good pair that wasn't $200. I saw an article that recommended these saying they were very good for the price. I read most of the reviews and they were very praising. Anyway, I've used them about 20 times and they're very pleasing. They sound better than my old ink'd skullcandy earbuds. I prefer the bass setting, the treble one is tin-ey and the balanced one is like medium warmth porridge--not good in either way. They pair very easily; the magnets are helpful when not listening; the price is incredible. To me, these are the best choice if you don't want to spend $200 for something like Sony and Bose. Thank you Aukey for an amazing product."
5	:	"So after I wrote the below review, Aukey reached out and sent me a new pair, no questions asked. Haven???t had any issues with the new ones yet, very impressed by the customer service. Thanks!Originally loved these headphones - good build quality and design for a low price. However, after only a couple months of light use (never in rain/wet conditions) the headphones have stopped working completely. They will not turn on or charge. A week or so prior to them totally stopping to work, they had issues pairing and turning on reliably. If these headphones were more durable I would strongly recommend a purchase, but with them completely breaking under normal usage after only a couple months I can't recommend them."
5	:	"These have been working very well for me with my Apple Watch, allowing me to ditch my phone on runs.  I'm happy with the battery life, just have to remember to charge them now and then.  I've had some issues with the headphones seeming to pop on and off while running, but it turned out the problem was with the bluetooth on my phone, and the headphones were jumping back and forth between my watch and the phone when I was at the track (with phone sitting on a bench nearby).  As long as I have both with me, it's fine.  Very happy with the purchase, and they're a great value."
5	:	"I bought these to replace wired earphones for working out. I was worried about them falling out in a 5K I was running but they gave me no issues at all! I've used them for multiple other workouts and other than the occasional adjustment they stay on well. The battery lasts for about 8-10 hours on a single charge. My only (minor) issue with the headphones is that the ""low battery"" sound goes off only about 5 minutes before the battery completely dies. It'd be nice if it gave a warning earlier on to avoid music-less commutes/workouts, but this hasn't been a major issue."
5	:	"I have tried about 10???different sets of bluetooth headphones over the last several months. Would buy and then return them if the speaker wasn???t clear enough - I was looking for a pair that sounded good, had a decent battery, but also where the speaker was clear for phone calls, because I am a Sales Executive and Recruiter.  So, many pairs that Ive tried sounded muffled to the person on the other side.  These seem to work well so far!  no complaints from clients I???m speaking to, and the sound on my end is also clear.  So I have been using them on a daily basis, for business calls and then for music while working out.  Charge time is also decent from dead to full charge.  So I would recommend these headphones and will likely buy them again down the road. Hope this helps: )"
3	:	"I got these for around $20.  The fit is awkward but I???m not used to this type of earpiece.  IThe sound quality is ok but the highest volume could be louder...  I use these mostly for phone calls.  The connection and distance range is good and they don???t cut out.  They???ve never gone dead on me yet, even after long use.  Charging takes about an hour but like I said, I???ve never run them completely dead.  All in all, I like them for what I use them for."
1	:	"I got the h adphones to pair easily with my Apple Watch which is the main reason I bought them. I got halfway through the first song before they shut off and I could not get them to turn back on. They were fully charged and there was no reason for this. Hopefully mine were just defective and it???s not a quality issue. Safe to say, I will not be purchasing another pair."
5	:	"The sound quality of this sounds great, but the only issue was that the cord is too stiff. It eventually becomes annoying because the cord is so stiff that it pulls the earbuds out of my ears when I slightly turn my head. Again, the sound quality is great, but at this price, they should've made the cord a little more flexible.Updated (11/21/2018):Aukey probably has the best customer service ever. They instantly reached out to me shortly after I submitted my review. I truly appreciate how they took the time to review what I was having trouble with, and then quickly accommodated me. Therefore, I will give Aukey a 5-star rating for them taking instant action towards their customers' issues."
5	:	"I haven't had them for long at all but so far I am extremely pleased. The build quality seems decent, especially for the price, they are light, the sound is quite good, they are relatively loud and give a somewhat full sound for a device running on tiny batteries, they fit securely in my ears (and have other size adapters if your ears are different), and they are very easy to pair with a device. If they last well, they are absolutely fantastic for the price!"
1	:	"3/31 Update:Aukey sent me a newer revision. The volume problem was fixed on the iPhone 7, however now there is an annoying buzzing static tone in the background on both my Pixel 2 and iPhone. Still do not recommend.Original Review:These headphones are too loud on an iPhone 7 at lowest volume setting. Works well on Android though. However, simultaneous device pairing doesn't work for me."
4	:	"If you're not an audiophile and aren't concerned about noise canceling, the AUKEY Latitude Bluetooth Earbuds do a great job for a low cost.  The set up (pairing) was very straightforward and the subsequent reconnect is effortless.  They're lacking any real bass or depth as compared to high end Bluetooth ear buds, but again, for the money they sound great.  For the record, I use a high end noise canceling set of Bluetooth ear buds every day at work for taking calls and listening to music and these compared nicely.  The AUKEYs will be my back ups going forward."
1	:	"I???ve gone through a number of wireless headphones since I???m an endurance runner and unlike everyone else here I don???t review after a single day of use. I???ve had these for weeks now and I???m so annoyed I???m writing this review mid workout. Time and time again the buds slip out of my ears. I???ve tried all different configurations of bud size and ear hook size but no matter what, they slip out after 20 minutes of sweating. Not to mention the ???EQ multifunction??? doesn???t even work. I???d return these but I???d rather use the shipping money on my next pair. Do not recommend."
5	:	Bought wireless headphones for my husband for truck driving. He likes them. More comfortable than wire headphones especially when you drive a lot. It is very well packed and comes with a cute small bag for keeping head phones and charger.
5	:	"I've had these headphones for almost a year now and the quality is still as good as the day I got them. They can play music nonstop for 8+ hours, so battery life is rarely a problem. They fit comfortably, block out a little bit of noise, and have good sound quality. They connect immediately to my phone with no problems. The only issue I've had is that I lost a rubber part when pulling them out of my pocket once, so I've had to switch to the back-ups. I would say they are a great value considering the high quality and the fact that they seem like they will last well over a year."
5	:	"I like the magnetic feature a lot. It connects to my android phone faster than my other bluetooth headphone. I never had issues connecting the headphone (this is my second bluetooth headphone I own. I had to turn the old headphone on and off in order to connect to my smartphone). The battery life is excellent. I charge it once and it lasts for about 3-4 workouts (usually 40 mins per workout). It doesn't fall out when benching or doing squats. The sound is beyond my expectation for the price. Overall, I am very happy that I pulled the trigger. If you are a gym rat like me, I highly recommend this product."
4	:	"Very Good Bluetooth Earbuds.I bought this after reading reviews of almost 20 bluetooth earbuds but everyone of them had some or other issues like No Bass, Lagging etc. I ordered this one because it did not have those issues in the reviews. Here is my review after using it for 2 days:Product Build:1. The build of the product is good and sturdy.2. The ear buds are comfortable not hurting the ear.3. The wire connecting both earbuds is long enough to go around the neck but the wire is not flat wire.4. They stay at their place even if I am running.Sound Quality1. Sound quality is awesome with Good Bass. I feel better than my Apple earpods.2. The 3 EQ modes is a unique feature which others don't have.3. There is NO LAG while watching videos on whatsoever app (Youtube, Netflix, Facebook etc)4. I don't hear anything if I am at 60% volume in the loud gym so it do cancel the noise from outside.AUKEY Latitude Wireless Bluetooth Headphones, 3 EQ Sound Modes and aptX, Magnetic and Sweat-Resistant Design, Wireless Earbuds with Carrying Pounch for iPhone, Apple Watch,??Samsung, Echo Dot and MoreI liked the product very much and its worth the price I paid for."
4	:	"After about a month of use I'm generally pleased with these.Sound is fairly good with decent lower frequency response for such a small unit.Battery life is not bad--can't give a precise figure but it's noticeably much better than other similar very small wireless BT headphones I've used.EQ is helpful for switching from music between music and spoken audio.Can't speak to the quality of the microphone as I've yet to take a call while using them.They are lightweight, comfortable, and fit securely, though I had to replace the earbuds with larger ones I had (I have larger than average diameter ear openings).Would recommend, and would buy again."
5	:	"I bought this wireless headphone during the Black Friday week for a very good price. I used it for a couple of days now, I can say that it is very good. The sound is clear and sharp, bass is okay. Battery life is good so far. Blue tooth connection is quick and easy. Fit to ear seem secure to me. Highly recommended if you don't want to spend a lot of money for a wireless headphone."
5	:	"These just arrived this afternoon.  I charged the battery, then paired it with phone.  The pairing was kid-proof easy, only instructions I need was which button/action put the earbuds into pairing mode.  If you buy these and own a smart phone, I don't want to read your lame review on  pairing difficulties.  It's user error, so take a college course.I'm still working out the in ear hooks, finding the best fit for me, but without the hooks I hardly know they're there.  The sound, like so many other reviewers noted, is beyond belief for such an inexpensive set of BT earbuds.  OMG...  not a hint of mud, and 3 built in EQ settings to boot.  I've got the Poweramp music app installed on my Pixel 2, so I set the earbuds to the middle/default position and let Poweramp's built in EQ take care of the rest.  When I switch to Pandora, no extra EQ settings, the sound is still phenomenal.  I just hope for $26 these hang on for while.Update 3/28/2018They're still working well, only negative I have is powering the headphones On/Off.  It seems you have to hold the button down for far to long, and if you don't have the right ear bud in your ear you'll can miss the On/Off tones.  Should you be outside, you can't see the flashing lights (single red flash for off, multi blue flash for on)"
4	:	"I just bought this weeks ago and only use for watching movies at home or with phone when driving but not for work out. Overall, nice without big issue, sound is loud and clear for my purpose. And I like it. I have nothing to compare with how good the bass is as others might wish to have. It fits tight and compact to use. Design and packing are good. I did experience broken communication once to understand what the caller was saying when using this headset with my Samsung Note 8 phone in my friend's car ride. Since my car is bluetooth enabled that I did not use it more to know more. I also got the broken sound via this headset blue tooth connection twice when watching movie on my computer. I then charged the headset to full again even it still has charge and dropped/paired the headset with my PC, then it is OK (not sure which one fixed it) and the issue did not come back so far in the past 2 weeks."
5	:	"For the price, you really can't do better than these headphones. They are easy to use and have great sound. I bought them to replace my $120 bluetooth workout headphones and won't be going back. I thought the cord would bother me on my neck but I barely notice it. The only time I notice it is when I'm spinning or doing poly moves because the buttons are kinda heavy and bounce up/down. If you're a runner you might want to skip them. They also come with different sized inserts for the hooks and ear pieces, which is perfect for my small ears."
5	:	"Bought this knowing that you get what you pay for. This however, exceeding those expectations. I get great sound quality, good call quality, and decent battery life. I used this in the gym and at work all day. It lasts about 2 to 3 days of steady and idle use. The magnets on the back make it easy for me to move about when they're not in use. I've had a few people ask me about them and I tell them I got them here and didn't break the bank. Honestly, worth it. AUKEY is usually dependable for me and this is the top of the list for me."
5	:	"I got these for my wife and myself in October of 2017.  To this day, we love them.  They seem to get mixed reviews, but as far as we are concerned, they have worked out great for us.  We use them about everyday at the gym.  They sound good.  The battery charge has not been an issue.  And they work.  It's that simple.  I have nothing bad to say about them.  If something comes up, I'll edit my review, but until then, they work great.  I mean, heck, they are not expensive either.  If they mess up...I'll get another pair.  Don't think the expensive major brand ones will not mess up either..because they will."
5	:	"Lost Them... Then bought them again.To me that statement alone should speak volumes.1st They stay in very well. I run sprints and occasional 5K's2nd They sound great. Good bass, full range.3rd The battery/control is very light and small but functional.4th Easy to connect and pair via bluetooth5th Low price!I am very happy with this purchase (Other than loosing my first pair.)"
5	:	"TLDR - Headline says it all.Long version - Been running with earbuds for many years and I???ve had dozens of earbuds. I got tired of spending big bucks for ones that lasted less than a year. Decided to start buying ???econo-buds??? and replacing when they failed. These earbuds are clearly better than anything at twice the price. After my first run, I had three issues - 1) left bud fell out every 20 minutes or so 2) I could hear a lot of ambient traffic noise 3) sound quality was good, but seemed awfully ???treble-y???. Decided to try something new - I went home amd READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. 1) changed out medium earhooks for (enclosed) large ones 2) changed out medium buds for (enclosed) large ones 3) changed EQ settings per instructions. Voila! All three issues successfully resolved. I love these earbuds."
4	:	"These were great for about 6 weeks. I had returned a pair of hundred dollar Bluetooth headphones and bought these and was very happy. Then one day it seems something faulted in the firmware, they stopped responding to button presses, both indicator lights would stay on simultaneously, and they didn't connect to devices. Too bad. Maybe you'll get luckier.Edit: after contacting AUKEY, they honored the warranty and replaced and refunded the original. Hopefully it was just a one off!"
5	:	"The first thing I thought about when I opened the box was that these are extremely sleek, lightweight and portable. The second thing I thought about was setting it up and going to the gym to test these out. When I opened the box, there were two more smaller boxes inside. One included the wireless earphones itself and the other included extra earbuds/charging cable. It also came with the manual and a small bag to store the earphones in. I was impressed from the first 2 minutes of unboxing the item. To set it up was a very easy process, just hold the button until it flashes blue & red and then connect your phone to the earphones. It took me less than 1 minute to setup and start using the earphones. The earphones performed better than I had expected, the sound quality was very good for the price and I noticed pretty good noise isolation with them as well. Later in the day, I went to the gym to test these out. I ran a mile at a speed of 7.0 on the treadmill and these did not fall out once. I will be using these very frequently and will update this review if anything changes."
5	:	"Overall, my experience with Aukey is wonderful. They have 3 different preset for EQ and i prefer ther balance. Sound is amazing and has a great bass. Sounds are balance and isn???t drowned over treble or even the bass. You could change your EQ to one or the other, but the balance eq is the best. Sweat does not ruin this guys at all"
2	:	"I had these earbuds for a few weeks, and it has been very pleasant! They have solid build quality with a nice, thick wire. Battery life is great, and while I have not used them until they died, I used them for about 5 hours and it reached about 40% battery, so I think the claim of 8 hours is accurate. I usually only charge once every 3 days. I used these for running, and they still in quite well. It did take me a week or so to find a good fit though.However, just a few days ago, the volume up button stopped working. Now I cannot increase volume or go to the next song, which is very annoying. I could not say why this happened, as I have treated them very well. I thought about water damage from my sweat when running, but they should be water resistant enough that this should not be a problem."
5	:	"Stepped up from [LG] HS730.Sound quality is not bad.Microphone is good.Crushed Game of Thrones ASOFAI book 1 this week while listening at work.  Battery life is sufficient.Like every bluetooth headphones I've used the last few years, when my phone is in my back pocket, it cuts out when I kneel down or turn my head a certain way.  Not the worst at it tho.  So connection is average for BT 4.*"
5	:	"5 stars for comfort, and usability. would subtract .25 stars for weak low-end tones, but wasn't expecting a full bass experience. great for use in situations where you still want to hear the outside world too. the included storage pouch is handy.  the ear-hooks work great for me, but might not for some. anatomy differs, go figure! 3 different sizes of hooks and buds are included though. watch out for lost ear-hooks which can snag on other things when not in your rear"
5	:	This is a wonderful headset. Great sound. Decent mic. Super customizable. Comfort is 10 out of 10. The comfort plus the excellent sound quality really surprised me. These headphones are hitting way out of their league at the price point. Company seems easy and good to deal with. They actually reach out to you to see if you are satisfied. I have many high end headphones as I'm in to PC gaming. For the price you won't beat these for listening to music and videos off of your phone on the go. The call quality is solid and respectable. You would be hard pressed to beat them at twice the price. They are even delivered nicely packaged neatly and including a nice carrying case. The positives just keep coming with these. Welcome surprise trying something new to me. These things even have excellent controls packed very neatly and tightly. Once you get used to them you can control your device with ease. Extremely impressive and would recommend for sure.
5	:	"These earbuds/headphones are the best quality(for a low price) that I have experienced in the last 2-3 years working out with wireless devices. No slipping out of ears (unlike some other brands), the sound quality is great, and the battery life is long, like ~14 hours! One caveat is that they don't give you any warning that they are about to die - but who cares since they last so long. I liked them so much I bought a second pair."
5	:	"I've owned a few pairs of headphones like this, and these work well. I found their audio to be good, and they stayed in my ears while I was walking to and from class. I imagine they would stay in just fine on a treadmill or lifting in the gym.On the recommendation of my brother who does use them in the gym I looked into these.I have not tested the range, as I am always around my phone."
5	:	"Nice volume. Nice fit. Support of aptX which is rare for this class of earphone. A little light to feel securely anchored if I have to run for  a bus, but I guess that's what the magnets are for.  I appreciate the reusable nested cardboard packaging; I'm tired of cutting my hands on throwaway blister packs.Just  one petty objection is the inclusion of 3 mode EQ. Every source device has some better form of sound shaping without the confusion of having it on the earphone in an undefined state . I have a fear that the double tap isn't enough of a guard from accidentally enabling the EQ"
5	:	"I've tried multiple pairs of JLab and Jaybird headphones at over 3x the cost of these Aukey headphones.  They failed repeatedly and would last no longer than a couple months and often less.  I sent them back over and over and finally gave up.  These Aukey headphone are still going strong and have been used for over 6 months, drenched in sweat and I've not had a single problem.  What really prompted me to write this review is after I accidentally sent them through the washer and dryer.  No problem, they still work fine!  Great product at a great price."
2	:	"Two separate things.1. Doesn't stay on while running.2. Packaging created a deep crease out the box that would have been an issue down the line.I figured getting a replacement for the crease, but having it not stay on was the deal breaker"
1	:	"EDIT: Great support from AUKEY customer service, quickly resolved the issue!Bluetooth connection to phone is unstable. During music playing there are many glitches that I can only assume are related to poor connection. Tried with 2 phones and a PC.I wouldn't recommend buying it."
4	:	"These are a superb pair of headphones. They're a very solid build quality but still feel good in the ear. They get a tad uncomfortable after long periods of time, but it's not a deal-breaker. I love the magnetic tips feature so that they hold together around my neck. Pairing them is easy they can even be paired with multiple devices and just switch the signal over. The quality could be better, they're not the loudest or the bass-iest but they hold up. The only real caveat I found with these that was annoying is the battery life. I am a heavy user for these guys and a full charge doesn't last me two full days. Charging these buds also takes at least an hour to two hours. All-in-all still a very good product for the price, very impressed with the hardy build quality."
4	:	"Bought these to wear while cycling and so far happy with them. It seems like there is a steep curve in the price when looking for really good earbuds. While these may not compare with a pair of beats they are better than most of the $15 dollar sets I've tried. Been using for a couple of weeks, pairing was very simple. Battery life seems good, haven't used for more than two hours before recharging. Charge time is short. They are fairly comfortable and while they do stay put I find I do have to adjust them every 20 min or so. Sound quality is decent with a fairly rich tone. Easy to answer calls while riding and call quality is good too. Overall strikes a nice balance between low price and function."
4	:	"I have a number of sub $100 wired headphones. This is my first foray into wireless. I primarily use these while at the gym. Its imperative to try out the different sized ear pieces and hooks to get the best fit. Sound quality is good at this price point. I found the different sound ""modes"" pretty useless and stuck with the default ""flat"" setting. I've had a few connection drops for a second or two but nothing that warranted frustration. Overall these are very good for the price."
4	:	"They're not etymotics (great audiophile earphones).  The sound is thin.  There are a few niggling issues like bluetooth on/off taking longer than it probably ought to.  BUT they're cheap and very serviceable.I miss my etymotics, but if you want bluetooth earphones that work (for listening and speaking) and that you can afford to lose (or buy on a tight budget) then these work quite well and I'm certainly happy with them."
5	:	"NOTE: My original review is below, but I was quickly contacted by Aukey who sent a replacement pair right away. Excellent customer service and will do business with them again!I bought these because I had heard really good things about them. Unfortunately, they won't connect to my MacBook  (2016 Air) at all. I've tried restarting, turning Bluetooth on and off multiple times. They just won't show up in ""Available Devices"". They connect to my phone okay (Android), but am a little disappointed that I can't get them to work with my computer. Something to keep in mind if you're thinking of ordering."
5	:	this for the price was good and it worked as advertised! would recommend.ONE YEAR REPORT:the magnetic clipping is amazing to be honest. the clips are comfortable and it has a good leash distance (I do walking lunges). It lets me not have my phone in my pocket at all for anything. Highly recommended.
5	:	5 months of gym use and it hasn???t let me down. Syncs easily with iPhone. Has just enough bass to enjoy. It is an in-ear headphone so I don???t expect deep bass like my over-the-ear headphones. I even use it when i ride my motorcycle. Helps reduce wind noise plus enjoy my tunes when riding. Am happy with this purchase.
4	:	"I am very happy with these earbuds. For the price they are awsome. The bass is very good and the feel and quality is exceptional.They do a good job staying in my ears while working out also.  I have accidentally drop these things in water a couple times and after promptly removing the and allowing them to dry off, they work like a charm.  My only complaint is the necessary extra long press of the power button to turn it on or off."
5	:	"These Wireless Headphones are incredible.  Audio is excellent!  Bluetooth does not drop. Great for running, do not fall out when running long miles.  I purchased more expensive brands in the past, and had to return them because too much bass or because the Bluetooth connectivity failed.  However, these Aukey Wireless Headphones work perfect.  Absolutely love them!  Hope they last for a long time."
2	:	"Sound is mediorce, which I expected from headphones in this price range, but the spotty bluetooth connectivity was a deal breaker.  Sent it back."
5	:	"After reading many reviews stating this is one the the best headphones for under $50 I was excited to get my own pair. I really wanted to like these. I enjoyed the convenience of the headphones having the magnetic feature. I liked that the wires stayed out of my way as I was working out. The sound quality had decent depth to it. However, regardless of the interchangeable ear pieces I could not get these to stay in. I don't think my ears are unique in anyway as apple headphones stay in just fine. It was rather frustrating and I feel I wasted my money.Edit: I was contacted by Aukey and they apologized for the issue and provided me a full refund and suggested I use it to buy replacement ear pieces."
2	:	"I purchased these knowing they were not noise cancelling.  However the max volume is so low that when I work out noise from others at gym is louder than music playing through ear buds.  i have experimented with various ear bud sizes, but that doesn't help."
5	:	"These work fine as far as quality of sound for running.  However, the cord is a little long, have to wrap it under the strap of my tank top or sports bra to keep from bouncing around.  Really my biggest complaint is the customer service.  One of the rubber ear buds fell off, and when I  emailed asking how to get a replacement I  never heart back.  Disappointing.UPDATE:  Well, I did hear back from the company after posting this review and they both refunded my money and sent me a brand new pair!"
5	:	Bought these for my uncle and was just told they randomly stopped working. he doesn't mistreat his things so I was surprised at how long they lasted. Wanted me to order them again but decided to go with another brand that's more reputableEdit: Aukey contacted me and sent a new pair of headphones free of charge because of my review and I can honestly say that's great customer service and that alone is what seperates a good from a bad company
1	:	"I do not recommend buying this product. It is incompatable with PC use and if you are trying to use it on your phone away from wifi, it will beep at you and skip over the audio of what you are listening to. It???s like it doesn???t want to be used on LTE/4G. This is a huge hinderance when you are trying to stream a lecture on a phone or tablet. These are the most frustrating pair of headphones I have ever used."
5	:	These earbuds are amazing!!! It pairs on my iPhone nice and easy and my phone can also detect the battery life of the earbuds.The EQ presets are also pretty good ( you can change them by double pressing the button on the middle.)And it also blocks outside noise pretty good.
4	:	"They say you can connect them to two separate bluetooth devices. But I don't have that same luxury. I was trying to use them with my Nvidia Shield TV box for watching outdoors, and my phone when I was traveling to/from work. Every time I had to re-sync it if I wanted to use the other device. So now I only use them with 1 device, but they work well and I haven't had any other problems with them."
5	:	"I've had Bluetooth earbuds in the past, and they've sucked. These are a huge step forward.First of all, pairing is fast and easy. Battery life is great, and charge time is short. Sound quality could be better, but it's fine. No problems with the earpieces falling out or getting uncomfortable. The controller feels rock-solid and the quality of the buttons is good.I haven't tried to use these for calls, just for music and such at the gym. For that they are excellent and I'm very happy with this purchase!"
5	:	"These are excellent earbuds, regardless of price.  I've had earbuds that cost five times as much and didn't sound nearly as good.  If you like good, clean, punchy bass you will like these.  The equalizer makes it adjustable for all tastes.  I'm very impressed with the total audio quality of these earbuds."
5	:	"I purchased this product in December 2017. Everything worked as advertised, Bluetooth connects every time and audio quality is clear.In October 2018, the right earbud stopped working. I reached out to a Aukey customer service and they replaced the product no questions asked. I couldn't be happier with their customer support. I would not hesitate to purchase/recommend Aukey products in the future."
4	:	"The only problem is that they don't pair well with my phone, the moto G4. But I bought a separate pair of head phones before these, the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones and they also didn't pair well with my phone. Audio cuts in and out sporadically. They both paired well with my friends phones and my laptop. Anyways, I prefer the ear buds here over the SENSO so far and will probably keep these and just wait to buy a new phone to use them with my phone."
4	:	"Very happy with these earbuds. For the price they are great. The battery life is good and they sound great.  The left side seems to be a little lower in volume, but that isn???t bad considering the price.  They are comfortable and paired to my Fitbit watch and iPhone easily. I would recommend these for anyone looking for a great pair of budget earbuds."
2	:	"I had just purchased a competing brand for about the same price (under $30.00) and saw that this pair was rated higher so I thought I'd try these as a backup pair.  The sound quality was so poor that the the folks I was speaking to on the other end asked me me to switch back to my other pair. Simply not happy with the pair.  Yes, they pair easily, yes the battery lasts a long time, but with these under $30.00 wireless pairs its hit of miss.  I'd say these were a miss."
3	:	"These headphones are okay. The battery lasts a while but there are some down sides. I dont know why my headphones sound kind of blown out? It's really noticeable and the higherthe volume the more noticable the grainy sound is. Also, a blue light is always falshing on the headphones. It's kind of annoying at night. I'd give this a 5/10. The sound quality is the most important part of headphones and the quality on these, from my expierence, is dissapointing."
4	:	I like the fact that these are wireless and hang around the back of your neck.  It's a plus to me to have them up out of the way when working.  For the most part these work like a charm but here lately they have been giving me problems even when I am in the same room as my phone.  But all in all I'd rate them a 4.  Thank you
5	:	Was really skeptical about these as I've been disappointed by headphones before and I've only used them once but they didn't budge while I jumped around testing them out and the multi-function and volume buttons work well. Couldn't test the skipping/pause functions as my music has been acting up on my phone and I can only skip/pause on it directly.
3	:	"I use these for the gym, they stay in well and the battery is great. Probably get two weeks worth of workouts in without having to charge. The only downsides are that there is a bit of statitc noise that they are a bit uncomfortable for me after 30 minutes. If you find that in ear earphones are typically comfortable for you, these are great. Otherwise I would try to find another solution. I wish I had bought a different product, but they serve their pupose."
4	:	A bit bass heavy on the neutral EQ setting but the mic is good and they fit nicely.UPDATE: Aukey reached out to me shortly after this review was published and offered compensation since I was not completely satisfied with the product. Updating this review from 3 stars to 4 stars for the simply superb customer service.
2	:	"Purchased these earbuds as a replacement for another set of ear buds. The sound on the Aukey equipment was tinny but acceptable for exercise. The controls are easy to manipulate and I liked the FF and RR functions for skipping soundtracks. Unfortunately, the earbuds developed a static noise on the left side. I tried the steps outlined in the directions to no avail. The return policy only lasts for 30 days so I'm stuck with earbuds that seemed doomed for the waste can."
5	:	Wow. Do I love these ear buds!!! I was skeptical at first just because of the price but I was just looking for something I could use for working out or walking to class and these are amazing! They have great sound quality and stay in my ear perfectly!! The only complaint is that there is a little white noise in between songs or if a song is super quiet with little bass but you don't notice it unless you're really paying attention to the sound!! Over all a great pair of ear buds for the price!
3	:	"Bought them due to the review on the Wirecutter. When they work, they are great for jogging, but I have now had three pairs fail in four months - specifically being unable to power on or recharge. Aukey Customer Support has been great about promptly replacing the units under their 2 year warranty, but it's hard to recommend a product that fails this frequently. These can make for a good backup pair and again when they are working for $25 they definitely punch above their weight as a pair of exercise earphones, but I can't recommend them as your go-to pair for exercising when there's always a question of whether they will work."
2	:	"These are not comfortable and don???t fit well. I tried all the different ear interface pieces provided.  The sound quality is poor.  High treble, weak in the lower frequencies.  Good price but I would not recommend."
1	:	*Update after using these for awhile. Gave up on the low quality sound. Tossed them in the garbage.This is my new backup headphones to use while charging my Bose wireless headphones. Low cost headphones with low quality sound. Sound is very tinny with no bass. Just know what you???re buying.
4	:	"These work well. They seem like they want to fall out but they don't As stated in other reviews, if you shorten the cord, turning your head makes them pop out of one ear. I use them for weightlifting so not a lot of movement and they stay in place and sound pretty good."
5	:	"Update:First: I want to say thank you to AUKEY to listening to my problem and solve the problem professionally and very quickly.Second: they have returned my full refund and sent me a new product immediately, and there was no need to return my item, (this is one of the reasons I chose AUKEY).Thirdly: my friend got the headset and was very satisfied with it.??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????-I like the AUKEY headphones I have used for almost a year and it is great, so I wanted to buy it again for my friend as a gift, but after I got it, my friend could not control the volume button through AUKEY, the control is only from the his mobile."
3	:	The pair that I received have a below average sound quality.  Lacks any type of full sound.  Some of the songs on my playlist sound almost like they are different recordings all together.  Does not get loud enough.  I also tried different size ear pieces to try different fits in the ear and the results were the same.  Would not waste your money....unless I just received a lemon pair.
5	:	For the price couldnt have asked for more. I use them to work out with or clean. Going to list a few cons but for its price they dont bother me personally.Pros:Last long enough for when i use them.No connection issues as long as the phones on me.Plenty of volume control and can reach loud enough to drown out the world.Easy to pair.Comfortable  (may take a bit of changing sizes to find comfort though)ConsNo way of seeing battery life.Sometimes conncetions issues if on different levels or a few house rooms away.Quailty is eh but gets the job done
5	:	"So far,  the product has worked exactly, if not a little better, than advertised. It seems to be holding up so well that I doubt that I will ever have to use the 24 month warranty. I have a problem hearing dialog consisting of a lot of bass. The 3eq settings let me change this to where I can hear the dialog very clearly and that was what I was mainly looking for in purchasing the product. As a matter of fact, I purchased a second AUKEY device of like kind, in case I ever needed a spare set."
5	:	"I wear these headphones when I'm running on a treadmill and they're fantastic - they never fall out, which is really rare in headphones, they sound solid, and the battery life is pretty long - I usually go 1-2 weeks without having to charge. Overall, the quality is great for the price. They also come with a nice little bag for easy carrying!"
5	:	"I bought these headphones for the gym but I ended up using them first while using a loud leaf blower and I was shocked at how much they muted the outside sound.  The fit is great, they don't fall out of my ears, and the sound is very good for the price of these.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  My last pair of bluetooth headphones were 150 dollar bose and they don't sound much better and definitely don't fit as well on the ear and they no longer hold a charge and have to constantly be plugged in."
4	:	The magnetic component is great. They look very nice. They sound good too although I have not used them a lot. They fit comfortably in my ear but they also send some other pieces in case they don't. I really like the magnetic component. Put them around your neck and forget about them. So simple and so nice.
5	:	"Couldn't be anymore happier with the price of these compared to the quality, fit, and sound.  It comes with 3 preset EQ sound stages built in. They may not be perfect, but it's nice to have some options rather than whatever they give you. Sound isolation is VERY good on these things. Nice carrying case to store the headphones, and the magnets hold well on the headphones themselves."
4	:	"For the price, these are excellent.  My previous expensive (JLab Epic2) were four times the price and would sometimes break up and lose reception if too much of my body was in the way (think cycling with phone in seat-bag).  I've had no problem with these at all.  Would be nice to be able to activate Siri via the controls, but otherwise I'm impressed how good these are."
1	:	"I ordered these because the NYT Wirecutter site recommended them for exercise. The first time I used them the sound began to crackle, sizzle and pop once I began to prespire around the neck. Obviously I got a defective set. I returned them right away."
1	:	The ear buds fit nice but the range on these is terrible.  If I put my phone in my pocket they start cutting out.  I bought these to listen to my TV late at night and even though the TV is about 12 feet away I cannot use them as they cut out constantly.  The only time these work is if my phone is sitting on my desk about 2-3 feet away.  I would not buy these and don't understand how they are rated so high with the limited range.  They are supposed to be able to work 30 feet away but that is not true at all.
5	:	"Initially, I was disappointed with the sound quality, but I knew from experience that I had to change the  rubber earplugs to fit my ear canal.  Luckily, I had some available and once I changed them, the sound quality was excellent.  What makes this item a good buy is that the battery life is excellent.  I tested them out.  I listened to music and watched YouTube videos for about 6 hours and the battery was still alive."
3	:	"Great product while it lasted. After about 10 uses the headset will not turn on anymore. It will light up red when charging, but won???t turn on so that you can use them. Good while it lasted. I bought the warranty on them but because they broke within a year (only a couple months) the warranty won???t cover it. I have to call manufacturer and try to get a replacement."
2	:	"Poor sound quality, too big and clunky.  Won't stay in my ears."
3	:	I ordered these because they had such good reviews for the price.The battery lasts a while which is nice.But they do have interference often. I wear them more than just working out and running. So this is dissapointing. But again for the price they are good.
5	:	"First looking for good enough quality while walking or riding my bike to listen to audio books or radio.  Check, though heavy wind does have an effect on hearing. Next being hard of hearing, needed something that had the column and fit.  Check again. Almost on a par with my skill daddy headphones.  Great price"
5	:	"These headphones were actually quite a nice quality, they sound great and stay in the ears well. It is a little odd to put them in, but while different, the design made it easier for the headphones to stay in nice and snug. I noticed no lag between my phone and these headphones which was also very much appreciated. Highly recommend!"
4	:	"Super comfortable, the rubber hook keeps buds in my ears. Sound quality is B+. My only problem is that the battery unit rests on my neck and turns off when I get hot when exercising. So I loop it up over my ponytail or through the back of a baseball cap to keep it off my neck and it works just fine."
5	:	"These are the most durable earplugs I have found. I use them daily. No issues with connectivity. Many useful functions.I???ve had them in rain an used when working out so I know I got them wet. No issues whatsoever. A really great product!!!If you???re looking for BT headsets, forget the Apple-no-wire-overpriced-plugs. These are great to have handy because you can leave them hanging around your neck and the magnets just click together and hold tight enough where they do not fall off."
5	:	"Not bad for the price. I thought the little ear ""wings"" would be annoying and not work but they actually do help hold them in place. Sound quality is okay/acceptable. The 3 control buttons are very well defined and easy to distinguish and push. Bluetooth synced easily with phone."
1	:	"You get what you pay for. Worked fine for one 25 minute jog, now the sound cuts out with each step taken while running. Same happens during lifting. It's fine if you aren't moving but try to run and its complete garbage. Definitely not for working out at all."
3	:	"The Headphone audio quality is good and never drops out.The Mic though, mid call it unpairs the mic from the headset or something. Though this may be due to my phone being stuck on 4.4 Kit Kat. Will add to this review later if my new phone coming in 20 days does not have this problem.Charge very fast and stay charged from my needs. I have at max 3 hours away from a charger as one is in my car, though I have not been forced to charge them at an unexpected time yet."
1	:	"Even with the volume up all the way, the sound is too low, the ear piece hurts after several minutes and it constantly falls out of my ears. I would not recommend buying this product. You'd be better off spending a few extra dollars on a better name brand."
4	:	"The audio quality is quite good, the bass is definitely deeper than standard apple headphones. The 3 EQ settings aren't very good and i wish it had a better way to tie the extra loose cable behind your neck for when you run. But other than that it's a really good bang for the buck."
5	:	"Great wireless headphones at an unbeatable price.  Surprisingly comfortable to use (and I say that as someone who dislikes things in my ears).  I bought a pair for myself, then my son borrowed them and never gave them back, so I bought myself another pair!  And still feel like I got a good deal."
4	:	"The earbuds work amazing for this pricepoint. The noise cancellation is pretty good, and the magnets that connect the earbuds aren't super weak like many I had in the past. The pairing is super easy, but having to hold the multifunction button for 5 seconds, everytime you want to use them is a little too long for me, especially for turning on/off. Another problem is the 3 eq modes, first of all I don't know which mode I'm set on, second most of the time switching between modes does not seem to work, maybe I'm double clicking too fast or something, but most of the time it doesn't work. But that does not hinder the functionality of earbuds, since most don't have this sort of flexibility. I would definitely buy the next version."
4	:	"Really liking the upgrade from wired to wireless.  Impressed with the features.  But lost the rubber snugging device second time I put them on.  Just popped off and disappeared.  My other earbuds go without, so I guess these will too.  Just wish the on-off function had better visual feedback."
5	:	"Well these were a welcomed surprise. 3 EQ modes, one of which has a much lower bass setting which I appreciate, longer battery life than my pair of Phazors, and come with all the ear forms you could possible want or need. Aukey has made a believer out of me."
4	:	"Very good overall design and great for the price. Works well, mic is good for talking, magnets are really nice to have, and paring with multiple devices and then switching is very easy. However, I have smaller ear canals and even the smallest tips that came with the product are not able to achieve a great fit. For future design's, I would consider having a smaller circumference to the speaker for buds. If you don't need to use the smallest tips when buying earbuds, this product will suit your fancy."
5	:	Good sound. Light and fairly long battery life.  They stay pretty securely in my ears.  I occasionally like to only listen with one ear and when I do that the other side hangs all the way down in front of my chest.
1	:	"I bought this unit due to the price and the reviews.  However, after one full charge and three trips to the gym (about 5 hours), the batter needed charged.  I took it home to charge only to find out that the unit would not take a charge.  I tried other micro-USB cords, just in case, to no avail.  Don???t waste your money.  Save yourself some time and money, splurge and buy a better brand."
5	:	"For the price, these are just fantastic.  Now I see why everyone rates them so highly. Not only great for the gym, watching videos, but they're even great for music.  I'm a lifelong audiophile, and very critical of headphones/earphones.  These are ""way good beyond their price"".  Play with the EQ settings, sit back and enjoy the fact that you saved a ton of money by not buying horrid ""Bose""."
5	:	"Better than expected.  The only way I could get them to stay in while running and sweating was to use the largest pieces. It kind of all jams into my ear and stays out while creating a sound barrier from the outside world.  All other sounds are muted similarly to putting your fingers in your ear. You can hear your internal sounds (breathing, swallowing, and your own voice booms over all else, this can be very strange if you use the headset to answer a call)"
5	:	"Incredible value for money. These headphones just last and last in terms of battery life and have sound quality comparable to much more expensive headphones I've owned or tried. They also stick in my ears really well due to the different silicone tips, which is a rarity especially for bluetooth headphones. Great buy."
4	:	"I recently got the iPhone X and since having headphones with the jack was out of the question I had to choose between the infamous dongle or a pair of headphones. I choose correctly, lol. These headphones have a good fit but they do seem to slip out from time to time. They have a good sound to them and the battery life is also something that lasts a VERY long time."
5	:	"These are excellent wireless headphones.  The battery lasts a long time, enough for over one, possibly two work days.  The sound is average compared to headphones in the same price range.  The blue tooth connection distance reaches from 3 rooms away in my house.  Overall, a good buy and definitely worth the price.Pros:Good soundLong battery lifeLong connection distanceNo cutting outCons:Mine was missing the small set of silicone pieces"
5	:	"A few months back I got a new phone without a headphone jack and it's been inconvenient and annoying for someone who spend a lot of time listening to podcasts.  After forgetting/misplacing my headphone adapter several times per week, they ultimately stopped working reliably so I begrudgingly decided to order these headphones at the advice of a wirecutter article.I'm very happy that I did.  My main concerns with going to a set of bluetooth headphones were that I wasn't thrilled about having to charge yet another device, general fit and comfort, and I was concerned about overall bluetooth connectivity/reliability.  I've been pleasantly surprised on all counts and will likely order another pair of these to keep one set at work and one at home.  The added benefit of them being (mostly) wireless is that I'm not tangling with a long headphone cable going down to my pocket, which I will admit happened way more that I'd like.I'm no audiophile so don't put too much stock in my opinion, but I think the sound is good or certainly good enough.  There are 3(?) sound presets that you can change by double-clicking the middle button, and there is probably a setting that will suit most people's preferences."
3	:	These do okay for a cheaper set of headphones. I am a person that when listening to music like a clean crisp clear sound and these have a tube or pipe sound to them. I have paid about the same amount of money for other headphones that sound much better than these!!!
3	:	"The ear piece itself hurts and doesn't fit well.  Had to take off the plastic insert that goes above because wouldn't stay in my ear with that attached.  The sound quality is not the greatest.  It has a surface sound, no depth at all.  There isn't really any bass.  Those are the 2 issues I have had with this purchase."
3	:	They work great if you are just using them for music.. as soon as you try to use it for a phone call your voice is muffed on the other end. Everyone complains about it. Now I use use it only for music.
5	:	These are easy to pair once you reset the headphones. I love all of the different size options for the earbuds - I finally have in-ear headphones that fit and don't hurt after awhile. The sound is excellent. They last a decent amount of time for workouts. I'm so happy!
4	:	Nice comfortable headphone. Bought a pair for my teenage son and I both and we really like them. The only down side is the SUPER tiny charging port that is kind of a hassle because it's so small.
2	:	"Had to return this unit. It couldn't sync with our Google Nexus 6 and Samsung S7 Edge, but I was able to connect with our Toshiba laptop only. Can't keep an item that only works with one device."
3	:	"These ear buds sound and feel wonderful, but if you're the type that wanders around the gym (or far from your phone or device playing your music) beware! The range on these isn't more than about 10-15 feet. Aukey might have higher-end models with more range. For the price, and if you keep your device in your pocket or close by, these are excellent!!"
5	:	"Great for anything???even if it???s not for athletic purposes. I use these when I bike and run, as well as when I???m working. My favorite part is the magnetic earbuds that act as a necklace when I???m not using them. They???re both easy to use and comfortable, but I find that they hurt my ears if I only have one earbud in. Because they???re not made for that purpose, I don???t really mind it. These are amazing???especially at such low price!"
5	:	"Thier not bad. Theres only two issues I have, headphones don't stay in ear very long before they fall out, and when your using bluetooth they cut in and out alot losing your music alot. Not sure why they do this. After writing this review Aukey contacted me about sending me a new set. And I received them fast. They really want to make sure your happy with their products. A++++ company I'm very impressed"
5	:	I purchased these headphones after my old wireless pair dies while I was working out with them. These buds are much better. I have been using them for several weeks now and they have worked excellently for working out or just walking from place to place. The sound quality is excellent and the buds are comfortable in my ear. The magnetic feature is very useful as well.
3	:	"I have only used them once so far but they were really good! I used them for running and they didn???t fall out at all! My only problem was that they were supposed to have a range of 30 feet, yet they barely worked when I set my phone on the other end of my table. They are great for running, but for me, they wouldn???t work so well for using around the house."
3	:	"These headphones work well and connect fine, but i think there is an issue with using for phone calls as they don't work so well.  Also they end up running out of juice regularly even though they show up as having 60 percent battery on my iphone."
2	:	"The sound quality is quite good. However, the fit and finish of the bites them selves leaves something to be desired. I found great difficulty in getting the earphones to remain in place while running or working out. Disappointing"
4	:	"I I like the air buds; the only problem I have with them is the fit. The curved rubber piece that goes in the ear is able to rotate. The Anker earbuds I have keep a fixed position and because they stay better with less adjustment. They work great it just takes a little more effort for them to stay in place, they will stay just not as user friendly."
5	:	"Doesn't sound as good as my $149 Apple Airpods, but for the price they sound just fine, and they work reliably (unlike the Airpods). I got these as dedicated running earpods, they work well for streaming music from the Apple Watch without an iPhone while running."
1	:	"Hated these. Hurt my ears to wear them, and you can???t wear just one without the other pulling down. Was able to return these."
3	:	"This is a mixed review.I have many products from Aukey. Wireless battery chargers, cables, adapters, etc.... So I felt good about trying these wireless headphones.And to be honest, there was a lot to like!  I think the sound was better than any wireless headphones I've ever had. Great sound!!  Also really really good battery life! Excellent!The problem? Some kind of microphone issue I guess, although it is weird.The absolute main reason I used Bluetooth earphones is to talk and text on my phone on a daily basis. Yeah, music is awesome, but communication is what I need first and foremost. Folks had trouble hearing me on conversations. I would digitize, be hard to hear, etc...  And the weirdest thing was text to speech! Always, and I mean darn near every single time, the first 3-4 words of a sentence would be wrong. And not just close/wrong, but not anywhere near the correct words/wrong!!  Darndest thing every. And completely consistent.Maybe I got a pair with a bad microphone as I said. Not sure. And the sound and battery life were so good that if the microphone function worked these would be a no-brainer 5-star rating device.  But I had to honestly review what I had....JL"
5	:	I???ve had these things for about 10 months now. So far they have gone way above my expectations. Usually when I buy a $30 pair of headphones I expect them to last at the most 6 months. They are very durable as I use them daily at the gym. The sound quality is also surprisingly good for this price range. I???ve only had one time where the Bluetooth seemed to not want to connect but another than that they have worked seem less.When and if these headphones ever die I???ll be buying another pair. Best bang for your buck.
3	:	"Update: I???ve now lost a second ear hook, making these headphones essentially useless since they won???t stay in your ears without the correct-size ear hook. Since Aukey doesn???t provided extras, or even sell replacements, I???m docking another star. Pro-tip: find the right ear hook and glue it in place.I have been very impressed by these; the weight, the sound quality, and the range are all very good. The ability to pair with 2 devices is also great. I have been carrying these everywhere since they magnetically clasp around your neck when not in use.Two minor complaints are: the lowest volume settings isn't as low as I'd like and the blue light always flashes to let you know it's on which is a bit annoying in low light.The only bummer for me is that the ear hooks can come off their ring and get lost (especially if you have a grabby toddler). I've now lost one of them and AUKEY doesn't sell/have replacements, so I'll either have to get by with a hook that's not the right size, or buy another pair. :(Otherwise though, these are great and I'd recommend them for anyone."
4	:	"Started out frustrated: couldn't get headphones to pair with my iPhone 7 despite repeated attempts.  Did all the maneuvers recommended by Apple: fail.  In the ""Notes"" section of the Aukey paper instructions that came with headphones, instructions to ""reset"" headphones enabled successful pairing.  Headphones sound great, fit well."
1	:	"I bought this because I saw a good review, what a disappointment.  The sound broke up every 60 seconds or so, it was not that great and I tried all three different ear pieces and none of them fit well at all, they fell out all the time.  Don???t waste your time and money on this product."
3	:	I used these for a few weeks of everyday use + when running. They worked well but broke within a few weeks. Maybe I just got unlucky but the construction must be faulty for it to break so quickly.
5	:	I had previously posted my complaints on the earphones and Aukey responded to my complaints. I believe that a company who goes out there way to answer to the average consumer is company who sells quality items and is a company worth buying from.
3	:	"To be honest, I was and probably still not hooked on the idea of wireless headphones. I just think that the technology needs to mature more for me to give up my wired pair of headphone/earphones. But for all purposes these pair, for the price is very bargain. Can't even explain how others charge more for the same quality. I really only use them for the gym and they are excellent for that task. Fit is good, sound...well for what you paid, you ought to be surprised it's decent. Charge will last I believe 7 or so hours. I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied for the amount of earphones for the money. Good job Aukey."
5	:	"Wonderful sound, easy pairing, all around the best bluetooth headphones I have owned! Got them for my Apple Watch based on on-line reviews. No regrets! I may have to get another pair for my iPad :)"
5	:	I loved these things so much ! I lost them because they come with this adorable magnetic case that's keeps every thing super tight and small untangled and loseable! I wish I kept better track of these cause these were the best things I ever paid for.
5	:	"Awesome! Bought these as they were highly rated by Wirecutter and I love them. Also bought as gift for family member who loves them, too. Lightweight, easy to wear for long periods and simple instructions for pairing with your device. Highly recommend."
4	:	"I was looking for a pair of wireless headphones to use when I get on the rower or lift weights.  I'm not an audiophile, so I don't need or want expensive headphones.  I wanted headphones that would stay in my ears, allow me to listen to music without disturbing others in the house, and that sound ""good enough"" to me.  These fit the bill.  I would buy them again."
2	:	I have had these for about 5 months. I use them most days of the week. Initially very satisfied with them. Good feel. Good fit.Over the past couple weeks people I am talking to are complaining about the quality of the call. I am constantly disconnecting them from the call and using my phone.Good for music. Not so good for calls.
4	:	"Very good sound. Very comfortable in my ears.  The weight of the control on the right side of the wire took a little getting used to (as in, a little figuring out how to keep it from falling out of my ear) but otherwise it's a Great product at at Great price."
2	:	"I bought these for running to sync up with my Apple watch. I read all the reviews and am disappointed in the purchase. First off, they won't stay synced with my watch - it starts out strong and as soon as I get down the route, they quit. It's so very frustrating. Secondly, due to the controls being heavy on one side, they flop over to that side as you run.I'm not a fan of these at all. My window has already closed to return them so I'm stuck with them."
5	:	"Decent headphones, I will buy again. I replaced the ""Beats headphones"" I had to return to Costco. They were $100.00 and the sound was horrible.For $25,00, these are very good in sound quality."
5	:	"I use these headphones everyday at work and I have no complaints. I have had other bluetooth headphones in this price range that didn't have the best quality, but the quality of these is definitely good. I haven't had any issues pairing these. The battery lasts me throughout a day of on and off use. I would recommend these to people who are looking for bluetooth headphones but don't want to spend a ton of money."
5	:	"Amazingly good performance for the price. I use it moderately and it has held up well. It doesn't block ambient sounds that much, so I feel safe wearing it while bike riding. It's comfortable to wear in bed."
5	:	"easy to use, comfortable, excellent sound volume and quality. Amazing bass. Surprising. if I didn't know I was wearing earbuds I'd swear I was sitting in front of 1000W 20"" subs."
5	:	"Bought these for a friend as a gift, but after I tried them I liked the the sound quality so much I kept them. I bought other kind previously and these are way better, the fit is extremely comfortable!!"
5	:	"Wonderful headphones, I was expecting less quality sound but when I tested them I was quiet impressed with the quality they delivered, what I don't like are the other modes, I just avoid using them, they sound quite good as default."
3	:	"I have to say the price is so attractive! This is my third day with it. The music was great, no problem with talking to people. However, I just realize that it is almost impossible to talk with others outdoor. The other end hears people talking and all kinds of noise at my side makes our discussion impossible to continue on the street. If you are heavily rely on a bluetooth headphone, I would not recommend it... But if music is your life, it is great enough!"
5	:	"As many of the other reviews state, these are a great value. The sound is good (and sound quality is important to me), the fit worked great for me out of the box, and controls work as expected. I haven't played with the EQs much, but when I did, I found the default preferable to the other two modes (both sounded odd and radical). I've only used them a few times, so I'll update based on durability."
5	:	"Love my Aukey wireless headphones, the sound is great.  I listen to r&b, jazz, easy listening and some classical and the sound is fabulous."
4	:	"This is my first time to use Bluetooth earphone/earbuds and I'm pleasantly surprised! These fit my ears well, do a decent job of blocking outside noises, and sound as good as my wired phones."
5	:	"Hard to find in local stores, thank you! So sturdy and works great on tough baked on food!"
5	:	"I have never written a review before, but after almost a year of using these headphones, these are the best headphones that I have ever used. They're durable lightweight and sound great. There are some minor quirks, such as cutting out the sound here and there and sometimes not willing to connect, but overall, it's the biggest bang for your buck. These are well worth the price, and I might even consider them undervalued. You can't go wrong with these headphones. AUKEY knocked it out of the park with these headphones."
4	:	"Had these for 3 months now. Been for many many runs with them, some in heavy rain. They're still kicking. Plenty of fitment options. My one downfall is that battery life seems to have gone down a bit, but honestly it's still really pretty damn good. I would buy them again"
4	:	"I bought an additional set of memory foam tips to compliment these. The tips that come with them don't sit well at all while at the gym. Had to constantly push them back into place. With the memory foam tips it improved significantly. Not a comfortable pair of earbuds for long time use, though. Not bad for the price."
4	:	"Sound quality Is pretty good for Bluetooth. Took me a week to find a combination of the different ear piece adjustments to finally get them to stay in my ear. Support was awesome when I wanted to return them. I ended up keeping them as they fit now. I've used them for about 6, one hour trips to the gym and still have half the battery left on the original full charge. Syncing to my iPhone 7 was a breeze. For sound, you get what you pay for but I think it's pretty good! I would recommend these if you're looking for something in this price range."
4	:	Very good sound quality. I just find them little uncomfortable in the ears
1	:	"Update 11/2018: The range of these rivals my *wired* earphones. Sometimes the audio cuts off at 4"" from my phone, and other times at 4'. Every time I use these I am reminded how unlikely it is that I will ever buy another AUKEY product. Really cannot believe that Wirecutter recommended these. Must have been some crazy affiliate commision structure.At first glance they look like nice earphones. I tried them on to discover that they are surprising uncomfortable. I figured it was just a matter of getting used to new earphones... two weeks later and nope.Bluetooth range is abysmal at best. My previous pair (From Taotronics and at the same price point) had easily 3x the range. On the positive side this likely means less EMFs going straight to my brain.Music quality is pretty good. Same with battery life.Overall a pair of earphones that would have lead the industry 5-6 years ago. For the price there are better options out there"
4	:	"Sound was ok, even though I experienced some skip a couple of times, and cell phone was in my pocket. Deal breaker for me was discomfort in my ears even with the smaller ear tips."
4	:	"These worked well, and they stayed in my ears much more ""solidly"" than others I've tried.  The controls are good; the mic works well.  I could do with more warning when the charge is starting to end."
5	:	"This is the second pair I purchased, but this time it was for my husband.  He needed a new pair of headphones and these had been perfect for me during my runs.  They do not slip, and they have excellent sound and connectivity."
4	:	"Great apart from left side with mic is heavier than right side. If i wear only my right in, it gets pulled down and i have to keep pulling the cord back up. Very very frustrating. For the price its is good and i like it for everything else. Love the magnetic earpieces."
4	:	Great quality for the price.  They connect to Bluetooth on my computer and phone easily.  The battery life is great it lasts me over 8 hours everytime and is always fully charged in less than 2 hours.  Sound quality is pretty good for how inexpensive they are.  Definitely better sound than earbuds or similar headphones.  They have some nice bass but not overwhelming.
5	:	"I was a little skeptical about these based on the price, but I figured it was worth a shot. I have to say these earbuds are awesome. Everyone that I've had use them has been surprised by the sound quality of something so inexpensive. They charge in a little more than an hour and although I haven't tested the battery life I'd say they last about 7 hours. Maybe a little more or less."
5	:	These are awesome! Bought for my husband and a red pair for myself to match my iPhone 8plus red. Pair very easily and great for listening to music or in a store where you can just tuck your phone away.
1	:	Used these consistently for about a week. They were great up until they would no longer charge. I guess I shouldn't be surprised for <$30.
5	:	"The best pair of headphones I've ever had! I haven't had to deal with their customer service at all.That being said, they arrived early, have a nice storage pouch and have great sound quality.  I've had them for about three months now and they work as well as they did when i first got them.  Comes with interchangeable ear pieces for a better comfort and a booklet with instructions to help you.  I run an average of 10-20 miles a week and these ear buds are amazing!"
5	:	Working great so far I've used this with multiple workouts and had no problems with sweat messing it up. They do bounce a bit especially on the left side where the controller is but it has been a very minor thing to me
1	:	"I ordered these headphones to use while working out or traveling. The first pair I ordered over the summer seemed great at first. But after a couple months, and maybe 10 uses, they stopped working. They wouldn't charge. Aukey, very nicely, sent me a new pair. But after the battery ran out, this set also stopped charging. So I used this pair about three times. Don't waste your money on this product."
5	:	"Worked great for 3 months. Used them during work out time. Not sure about their sweat resistance, mine made some funny noises during my last routine and stopped working. Otherwise they're great for the price. Says there is a 24 month replacement guarantee, so maybe I can get them replaced.Update: 3 days post review.Contacted Aukey support and they were really helpful. My broken ear buds are covered by warranty and they are shipping new ones to me. Great, fast service!"
2	:	"I like the concept of how these are worn. However, the sound is very tinny sounding...no bass. I also don't like the way the ear pieces fit as they don't stay in well."
5	:	"I needed wireless headphones for the gym,but did not want to pay a fortune. These definitely fit the bill. They have noise isolation and once you find the right combo of ear tips/ear covers they do not cause any discomfort."
5	:	"Excellent sound for the price point. Not as smooth as higher end Bluetooth earbuds, some harshness in the upper midrange and a bit of muddyness in the bass. But overall these are a keeper."
5	:	"They sound ""good enough"".  The battery lasts decently long given how small it is.  they're pretty comfortable too.But the best thing: I accidentally washed these in my laundry machine, and they came out working perfectly.  Hooray for the water resistance!"
5	:	I've had these for almost a year. Battery life lasts me 5 hours at high volumes. Bass in these makes it sound more premium than what I actually paid for. Durability is excellent. They still look as if I just purchased them.
5	:	"Extremely comfortable, great sound and great price. I bought these after trying several other wireless ear buds and these were by far the best. They paired easily with my phone and they reconnect almost instantly when I want to start listening. They stay in place during exercise and as added bonus the in-ear fit doesn't interfere with my eye glasses."
4	:	"It works fine, with fast connection with my Iphone. However, do not expect a great sound quality. It miss bass."
5	:	"Found this as the second-best choice on Wirecutter and much cheaper than their #1 pick. They sound good, the Bluetooth pairs easily and reliably. Very happy with them."
1	:	"Build quality seems nice, but if I walk around with my phone in my pocket the sound drops out. If I hold my phone in my hand while walking around its a little better. If I sit still at my desk with my phone in my pocket reception is fine. What's the point for Bluetooth headphones that only work when you are sitting still?MotoZ Play running Android 7.1.1Update: Aukey customer service promptly contacted me and offered to send a replacement. +2 stars for customer service. However, the earbuds arrived and they have the same reception issues. -2 stars. The old earbuds I lost??Wireless Earbuds Noise Cancelling In-Ear Headphone with Mic HD Stereo Sweatproof Anti-Drop 0.5oz Lightweight Noise Isolating for Sport Gym Running Workout for 8hours??did not have reception issue and cost half as much.TL;DRBad reception persists."
1	:	Received these headphones yesterday. Used them for the first time tonight and about 30 mins into my run they started crackling then disconnected from my phone. Head phones were fully charged and now seem to refuse to turn on or off/ will not connect to my phone. Really big let down after reading the positive reviews for these on Wire Cutter.
3	:	They sounds great and are decent when it comes to staying in my ears but the volume control is kinda heavyand flops around alot which can be pretty annoying on a run.
1	:	"I have an AUKEY wireless music player that I love...it???s got great sound .going on that, I ordered these ear buds but they were terrible. The sound was tinny and just not good quality .  I returned them and got my money back. Thank you for making it relatively easy to return them..."
3	:	These are OK. I feel they are too loud if you are in a quiet space. I don't like listening to things too loudly in headphones. The sound quality could also be better.
4	:	Sound quality is good considering cost. Battery life is excellent.Big con: the ear retainers fall off all the time without you knowing. All of mine are gone.
4	:	"For $25, these are great bluetooth ear buds. Very punchy bass and a good battery life. Only complaint is that the cable running behind the head can sometimes be hard to manage (snag, become unbalanced), but its still much better than a cable running to your phone"
5	:	"Compared with other inexpensive bluetooth headsets, these are excellent value. The sound quality is excellent, including for the listeners on the other side when making calls. Fit is wonderful."
5	:	Great product for the money!!! I was looking for a cheap pair of Bluetooth headphones until I had the money to get the pair that I wanted but these work wonderful. Granted I mainly use my headphones at work. I have done so mild workouts and I???m heavy sweater and haven???t had any issues. Battery life is awesome. I only have to charge every other day. Definitely would recommend these Bluetooth headphones.
2	:	"I did research on which sports ear buds to buy and I am really disappointed in these. First, they do NOT stay in my ears, the buds are huge and I tried other rubber tip sizes which didn't help. The battery dies quickly, too."
3	:	"Seem like decent headphones for the price.  But those little wings do not stay in my ear, no matter how I orient them, turn them around, or shove them in.  If you typically have problems with earbuds staying in, these may not be the ones you want."
3	:	The good:Sound quality is greatBattery life is greatEasy to pair with Android devicesThe bad:They will not stay in my ears.  I've tried every combination of included tips and holders.  I'm constantly pushing them back in.They're uncomfortable
5	:	"Very light headphones, excellent for gym and jogging time. I also like the shape of the earbuds, that stay stable in the ears. The whole product come in nice package. When I put them on, they keep other noise sound away."
4	:	These headphones were great considering the price. I own some expensive AKG wired headphone that understandably have a fuller sound. I am using the Aukey wireless phones with a bluetooth 2.1 iPod and the sound is quite good. There are adjustable ear plugs and ear pieces that enable me to fit them to the ear so they don't fall out. For any sort of gym workout the wireless headphones are superior in that they don't get in the way and you don't have to worry about them.
3	:	Don't depend on the clever magnetic clasp feature. A # of the reviews talk about what a useful feature that is - sorry - but it is not. It's not a strong enough magnetic field to keep them around your neck while walking around. Lost a pair that way. Other issue - needed to purchase 3rd party foam tips. The factory silicon tips - not comfortable. Other than that - nod bad.
5	:	First wireless headphone. easy to setup as long as you follow the instruction. It can control the audio player on your phone as well. It exceeds my expectation. Love it.
5	:	"Holds in place well during long runs, didn't have any issues with it sliding out of place.  I sweat buckets when running, never effected them.  Battery definitely lasts 10+ hours, recharges quickly.Stolen from my bag while showering at the gym after 2 months of hard use, ordering another pair."
4	:	"Relatively nice, bass-heavy sound (in the normal setting). Battery life is decent at ~8hr (not enough to last a full work day). Awkward pairing issues when paired with two devices at the same time. When I'm listening to music on my phone and walk away from my laptop (to which it is also paired to), the music begins to stutter and requires a restart of the headphones. This may be on the software side of my laptop or phone though."
2	:	"I loved these earbuds- worked great when I got them and I was satisfied with the quality and fit. However, after only a 3 or 4 months top of moderate use (2-3 times per week) they stopped working. I have no idea what happened, as I charged them regularly and put them away neatly in the included pouch. I am disappointed."
5	:	"These earbuds are very light, have a respectable battery life, and provide decent background noise block. A good value at a great price."
5	:	These headphones are great and they stick in your ear excellently! i prefer these 10x over the senso i bought! the sound is just a notch above mediocre considering these are only in ear headphones. They are great for exercise which is what i bought them for . The Eq settings are useful and they have their place. You cannot go wrong for their bargin price.
5	:	Battery is much better than I was expecting.  Lasts at least 6 hours (that's the longest one time usage I've had so far).  The ear wings work great at keeping the buds in my ears and they sound pretty decent.  The only thing I don't really like is that you have to hold the on/off button for a really long time to turn it on and off. I wish it was a little faster.
5	:	I loved these Bluetooth headphones so much I brought a second pair for work.  Excellent sound quality and battery life.
5	:	"I feel like these are a good value. I didn't want to cause sweet damage to my AirPods while working out, so I bought these specifically for runs and the gym. I won't might if these go out in a year as opposed to my AirPods. They stay in very well, which has always been a problem for me with in-ear headphones, the adjustable caps that it comes with pretty much guarantee a fit. I also like the pouch it came with. My only qualm is the sound can be a bit tinny sometimes, but I'm usually able to adjust the EQ settings for a better sound. I wouldn't really expect top of the line flawless sound at this price, so I'm not mad about it - just putting it out there. Overall great value for a pair a wireless headphones that I don't mind sweating on."
5	:	"The headphones are amazing, I purchased a pair of the Anker soundbud Slim's a couple of months ago. I felt like they were a good pair of headphones, but had no bass at all and a limited sound stage. I saw this pair in a YouTube review and decided to purchase them. Best decision ever this things sound just like my friends jaybird x3's but at a fraction of the cost. Aukey created a wonderful product and I look forward to what they come out with in the future"
3	:	"I don't find that any of the ear sizes work for me, and I don't think they offer enough bass."
5	:	"Aukey reached out to me on the same day I left my review. They explained options and while they don't have replacement parts, they sent me a link for a product that would work with theirs and refunded me 40% of the cost of their headphones which covered the replacement parts and some change. I am thrilled with this response, great customer service and completely changed my mind on the product. I got a product not up to their standards and they made it right immediately. Well done!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I really loved these for the last week or so since I got them. Until the curved silicone bit that keeps it in your ear fell off the right ear bud. It had a nick in the silicone when it arrived, but it didn't seem likely to tear so I shrugged it off and I assumed the silicone piece was attached - it isn't, it's a little sleeve like the ear bud tip. I should have returned it immediately for one that wouldnt arrive damaged. But, it fell off in the woods so here I am. Awesome."
4	:	"So far so good. Decent sound, don't fall out when running. Battery is ok."
4	:	"Easy pairing (after I read the directions. Lol).  Suprisingly good sound.  Music was loud and crisp with nice bass.  The earbuds are very comfortable and the set comes with a nice carrying case. I haven't tried the EQ feature yet, but I'm looking to doing so."
4	:	"I'm can take directions too seriously and as usual this little program is small with tiny type.  I admit I tried to get it active all on my own.After my usual frustration, I went to a friend who showed xyz and boom the headphones are working - now really easy to keep up with energy.  It's sound & convenience is great.  One con - as usual with black 'things' it's easy to loose so be sure to pay attention to it when hanging on neck without sound."
5	:	Awesome sound and on the fly adjustment of said sound is very nice to have. They are easy to use and come with a carry pouch.
4	:	"I don't do those hooks on the buds, but thankfully they're easily removable. Once I did that I found them very comfortable and they have more than decent sound for the price. I could always use more bass, but unlike other similar wireless buds, the bass is adequate enough."
1	:	"Bought two initially, one for me and my partner. Theirs didn???t charge initially, no big deal sent them back, ordered another. Well, just over a month later and now mine stopped taking a charge today. I???ll assume hers will give out in the coming month now. Disappointed. Anker???s other products have been great, but these headphones are garbage."
4	:	Overall I recommend this product. It is very good for the price. Battery life could be better and I would like more size options for the rubber ear inserts. Definitely a good buy for the money.
5	:	I love these as I have loved other Aukey brand headphones in the past. the clarity and sound are great. the only thing that upset me is that I bought these on prime day and then they went on sale fro cheaper the very next day :(. great headphones though for the price
5	:	"Great sound quality, connects to my iPhone immediately, and the earbuds stay in (unlike other earbuds which keep coming out). I'm buying a second pair for my wife."
5	:	Bought for my boys.  They like these ear buds.  Good quality sound and they like the fact that they magnetically stay together.
2	:	I don't know if I have weird ears but these fall out every time I run - it does not matter what size ear bud I have in - they fall out - which is seriously annoying at about 2 of a 4 mile run.  If you want to go any faster than a slow trot -  do not buy these head phones. The sound is probably pretty good - I just cannot keep them in my ears long enough to really hear anything.
2	:	"Just won't remain in ear while running. Not on small, medium, or large."
4	:	Great value for the money.  Excellent sound from easy to fit and operate quality ear buds. The only issue I had with the buds was that they stick out to far from my ears to be worn comfortably inside my (Arai) motorcycle helmet.
4	:	"These sound very good.... The ear rubber holders will hurt your ears after long usage, but its a trade off. Battery lasts a long time as well"
5	:	"So good so far. At the price I am very pleasantly surprised with these. The battery life is very good, and they stay in my ear much better than the Klipsch that I was using previously. Sound quality for me is good, but I am not audiophile so I may not be the best judge. I highly recommend buying these for gym use.Will most likely buy another pair as a gift!"
5	:	"Excellent product,price,service and shipping !! I will shop again."
5	:	"I was looking for some inexpensive wireless headphones to pair with my Apple Watch and these fit the bill. The sound clarity is great and the controls are fairly easy to use. I did wear them with a hooded sweatshirt and jacket and I did find that the cord around the back of my neck would get stuck to one side but I think with less clothing or in the summer, that may not happen."
5	:	Bought for my girlfriend. She had 3/4 different wireless headphones immediately prior to these. Had different problems w them all. From bad sound to falling out. These stay in and sound great. I can also hear her clearly when I call her and she has them in.
4	:	"These are good, reasonable headphones.  My problem is I need replacement ear-tips, but for the life of me I cannot figure out how to contact Aukey for this.  Maybe it's just me, but it's frustrating that it isn't more self evident, on the Amazon page."
5	:	"I really liked these earbuds because they sound good, are built fine, and have good battery life. I'm a student and these earbuds get me through the whole day without worrying about them dying (Unless I forgot to charge them). I'm glad they are waterresistant because I have them on all the time and I don't worry about the getting damaged by the water."
4	:	"Work well, but didn't come with the extra ear hooks. Which means they don't stay in my ears as well as they probably would. Sound quality is good, but I have to be sitting down or I'm constantly having to put them back in."
1	:	Never could get these to connect to my phone. There was only static when they were on. Returned.
5	:	Nice and lite a little to much bass but all in all their great
5	:	"I spent a lot of years in radio so I'm somewhat spoiled when it comes to headphones.  I always just assume earbuds won't measure up and, just based on physics, they really can't sound as good as high quality professional headphones.  No matter what size bud I use, they either fall out or don't seal well enough to transmit bass energy.  That's NOT the case with these headphones.  Do yourself a favor and buy a set.Now you won't confuse these, or any other earbuds, with a set of $150 wired headphones but they do a really nice job at a great price. They don't hook over your ear but rather nestle inside the inner curve of your ear. Very comfortable and they seal well enough to hear the bass and don't muddy up the highs.  One cautionary note:  I pulled them out of the drawer the other day and the two headphones were magnetically stuck together.  I tried doing that with some iPhone earbuds and other no-name earbuds and nothing.All that said, I wouldn't put the headphones anywhere near a credit card due to the storage magnets on the backside of the buds.As far as pairing it to your device, I was in a big fat hurry and misread the instructions.  I thought it said to press the power button and wait for the status light to alternate blue and red.  After a couple tries, I reread the instructions and saw it actually said to press the power button UNTIL the light status alternates.  In other words, press and hold.  Duh.  Once I got out of my own way, it paired just fine.It has an EQ option but don't bother as it just cycles between vocal/treble/bass.  For treble it rolls off the bass and does the opposite for the bass setting.  The stock ""vocal"" setting seems to be fine."
5	:	I absolutely love these.  They were so easy to pair with my new phone.  You can also pair them with multiple devices.  And they charge quickly.  I think they sound wonderful.  And they stay in my ears.
5	:	These little headphones are great! They hold a charge for a long time. I usually have to charge once a week.The range is good. They are comfortable and come with several sizes of ear pieces.  Wish they came with a clip to attach to my shirt.
4	:	"Awesome, but sometimes acts like it???s out of range but phone is next to me"
2	:	"With all of the reviews I decided to give them a try.  They don't fit in my ears at all.  Full disclosure: I have unnaturally small ears and have a really hard time fitting earbuds.  I thought these might just work.  Nope.  And they were painful, too.  Plus, there is a $6 charge to return them.  I'm not happy."
1	:	These had great sound for MAYBE a month. Now staticky and fuzzy. Bought the protection plan but honestly why would I want a replacement for headphones that suck and broke after completely average daily use? Sad that amazon would sell such a poor product.
5	:	Can't beat these earbuds for the price.  Sound quality is pretty good and battery life is decent at around 5-6 hours.
5	:	"Read reviews on this brand via TheWireCutter.com and they're FANTASTIC, especially if you can find them for under $20.Excellent, clear sound, hold a good charge and fit comfortably. If they stay under $15 I???ll likely buy a bunch of them for Christmas presents this winter."
5	:	Very handy.  Work as described.  I can walk through the house without losing audio or having to carry the phone with me.
5	:	"The build quality, the battery, the audio quality are so ridiculously good considering the price."
5	:	"I've had them for a few weeks. Great sound, pairs quick, comfortable ear buds, battery lasts a reasonable amount. And at this price, it doesn't feel like I need to take super careful care of them."
5	:	Love these headphones!Have had now for a few months. Work great for music at the gym as well as hands free phone use. Long battery life with each charge. Works very well pairing with both iPod and phone; when I get a call iPod pauses and headset automatically switches over to phone. After call music resumes.
5	:	"Have been using these for almost a week now, and i'm impressed... Esp with the bass. Lack of decent base is pretty normal with earbuds even today but these surprised me when the bass was crisp and solid! The range is far better than my wireless Beats and the controls are just as easy to use. Highly recommend."
5	:	Great sound quality for the price! May take some trial and error to find which earbud adapter fits best. Once I picked a good size it stays in during my long runs without a hitch. Syncs immediately with my iphone8 without a problem.
4	:	Except for the range of Bluetooth this headphones is great
1	:	"I never write reviews, but this one warranted a review. After 2 weeks of use, it no longer took a charge and completely died. When I plugged it in, the red light didn't go off, indicating that it was not charging. Not sure if I got a defective product, but I would recommend splurging a bit more and buying a nicer product that will not fail you as you are working out."
5	:	"The sound is clear,easy to wear, three choice of ear buds which is by far a great asset for this product.It beats any high end  headphones."
4	:	Should come with more back up early huggers!! They come off too easy
5	:	I love them! They just got here and they sound amazing and they don't take long to fully charge! I'll most definitely purchase again.
2	:	These headphones died after less than 2 months of light use.  They functioned as expected while they worked but are now just a crappy paper weight.  I do not recommend.
2	:	Right from the start these were poor sound quality. When I made a phone call there was a lot of static and the sound cut in and out. I returned them after this initial use.
1	:	"The wireless headphones worked fro a month, then they would not pair with my iPad. I get a blinking blue and red light and my iPad tells me to turn them on or they are out of range. I tried everything and still could not get them to work. I???m very disappointed since I???ve have several great Aukey products all working perfectly. Perhaps I have a lemon. It???s past my return date otherwise I would return them."
4	:	"Pros:Low cost, easy to use, has a volume/track controller and mic.Plays music fairly well.Surprisingly comfortable, I could wear these for hours.Cons:This of course doesn't satisfy the Audiophile in me, but for regular use, it does the job.Summary:I'm happy with this purchase, however I will be looking to upgrade to a higher-grade pair down the road."
5	:	"If you want some good wireless earbuds on a budget, these are the way to go. They're comfortable, the charge lasts a solid work day and change, and they sound great."
3	:	Mostly happy with these headphones - sound quality is fine. I use them to sleep. The only thing is that I don't get more than 7 hours of play out of them. I've only had them for 2 months and the battery life has already deteriorated a little bit.
5	:	"I don't know if these can be beat for the price. They work flawlessly for me so far with two devices and sound much better than expected. The stock earpieces fit my ears perfectly and don't move even when doing sprint type workouts. I imagine the wide array of other earpieces means they'll fit most ears. I recommend these to anyone looking for a good, budget set of wireless earbuds."
5	:	"The Buds paired flawlessly with my Iwatch 4. I use it at the gym to stream music with my watch. The battery lasts all week, probably longer. Sound quality is good very comfortable to wear. Very satisfied so far."
5	:	Great product! Daughter loves them????
5	:	Just as good maybe better than my Samsung Galaxy ear buds. I walked in light rain and snow with them and on and their still functional.
5	:	"I???m super impressed with these. Great sound quality, decent at blocking out background noise, comes with a variety of sizes for the in-ear parts. Would definitely repurchase."
5	:	"Works great, especially for the price. Haven't needed to charge yet, only used a few hours so far. The ear tips are easily removable, I have never liked those on any earbuds. My only real gripe is the controls are on the left, my previous set (another brand) had it on the right and I'm right handed."
4	:	"Pairs really easily, sounds great, just wish it gad a little clip to hold it to my shirt - it slides around if only one ear bud is inserted."
4	:	"Edit: Support team send a replacement and headphones are working well.I connect this earbuds to my TV and they keep connecting and disconnecting, tried with two phones and the same happens... What a waste of money. I don't recommend this earbuds. It's a shame, I cant return them because Im in another country."
5	:	I bought these to listen to music while working. If you can get a decent seal in your ear they sound great. The mic is a little too sensitive and when using them to talk on the phone the person on the other end complains about background noise but that can be overlooked if you???re just needing them for listening.
5	:	"Excellent Bluetooth headphones for the price.  I???ve been missing out till I scored these for fraction the cost.  Great product, great job"
4	:	"They fit well in my ears, have good sound quality and were easy to set up"
5	:	"Very pleased so far! Charges in ~1.5hrs, pairs on the first try, and I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable they are + the quality of the sound at this price."
1	:	"Got the product at a good time. Been using it for 2 days now and it gets really really choppy after a while. Need to turn off Bluetooth on headphones then back on before i can resume smooth play. This is really annoying. I've used it on 3 devices now, and it does the same thing. Not very clear."
5	:	My son is still trying to get them to work. Received on timeI believe it???s my son that cannot figure it out well do it for him
5	:	"I love these headphones. At first, I wasn't sure about them at first because I'd never gotten Aukey headphones nor had I gotten any with this design before. It was a little strange at first, but once you get used to them they're amazing. Sound quality is great, connects quickly, and easy to use!"
5	:	"Bluetooth stopped working after 3 months.  After one and half months the charging cable broke apart, but I luckily had another cable for my samsung over the ear headphones that worked.Update: AUKEY reachead out and sent me a free replacement pair of headphones after confirming my address."
1	:	"These do not fit my ears. They are too big for my ear holes and there are no sizes of rubber piece to help me customize. Sound quality is actually really nice but these literally hurt to put/have in, and slowly fall out of my ears because they do not fit. Frustrated I spent $25 on these."
1	:	"I am not pleased with this purchase at all. I am not sure if it is a glitch, but these are not keeping a charge at all. The quality of sound is good when I can use them. I don???t think they are standing up to the quality and claims on the package. Again, this very well may be a glitch in this particular set of headphones."
3	:	Static noise can be heard at low volumes/ when playback is paused/between songs. It is present even when using the earphones to make/receive phone calls
1	:	"If you are using these to workout they don???t work. I tried using them for cycling. Gave them 3 chances, they cut in and out so many time on the 3rd tire I gave up before I even went 1 mile. Save your money. I???m planning to return them"
5	:	"Battery lasts about 6 days if I work out everyday for 6 days in a row. I lift and run, which comes out to about 1.5 hours each day. Does not fall out of your ears, but are easy to remove briefly and re-insert to have conversations with people at the gym. Amazing for the price. Sound is good, not crap but not great either."
4	:	"The earphones sound quality is much better than I expected. I recently had a pairing issue after 10 months of use. However, after clearing the earphones storage (turning the device on then pressing all three buttons simultaneously) it's working again."
3	:	"Purchased these for running and gym workouts. Sound is fine, but they refuse to stay in my ears when I sweat. I???ve tried multiple combinations of earbud sizes, but whether I am running or simply doing yard work, they don???t stay in. Will be buying something different soon. Fine for simply listening, just don???t plan on doing anything active with them in."
1	:	"Stopped working less than two months after getting it. Don???t buy, not even worth $10. I???ve been trying to contact the company with no avail."
5	:	Never travel with our my AUKEY headphones - their extra magnet keep me from losing them!
5	:	These work very well! I don't have a need to use them often but it's a must w/ an i-phone 8.
4	:	"The headphones are a good quality, especially considering the price. My only issue is the silicone piece that goes in my ear fell off on one side on two separate occasions whiting the first couple of days. I???m not sure how I???m going to replace them but besides that everything seems to be as advertised."
2	:	"I've got those headphones just for a running, but I wasn't happy with sound quality so I started to used them to listen podcasts or audiobooks. Music sounded too flat.After a month of using they just disconnected in a middle of my run and stopped connecting to the phone at all."
1	:	"Very disappointed in this product. I???ve used them maybe 5 times and then they stopped holding a charge. I will fully charge them, use them, and they die halfway through the first song. I wish I could return these but I guess the window for that has passed. Don???t waste your money on these. Buy them from a reliable brand."
1	:	"They work fine during the first 2-5 days, then the sound slightly starts breaking up when you are listening to music, especially if there's wind. By 2 weeks or so, I was not able to play my music at all. They were also annoying to deal with because of the design."
4	:	I like them a loit but they don't stay in my ears!  I always have problems with earbuds popping out and I thought these would be different.  The sound is great and they are very portable.
5	:	"Amazing earphones!!! I really needed wireless earphones to use in the gym and these are perfect! The sound quality is very impressive and the short cord that connects the two pods makes it easy to run or do other forms of workout without having to worry anout ruining them! For the price that they???re offered at, they???re amazing!"
5	:	"Sweat-resistant, nice and powerful, isolate noise well - wonderful, especially for only $25. The earbuds snap together magnetically for easy storage. The wire that connects the buds is a tad long, but it???s only a minor inconvenience."
4	:	"this headset works well, its works well with the apple watch"
5	:	"Purchased as a present. According to the recipient, these have the best sound of any headphone they've ever used."
5	:	Awesome for the money
5	:	great headphones for my Olympic lift sessions at the gym. the mic and noise are not good but for listening to music while working out its great.
4	:	I like them. Sounds pretty goods.  Not super high quality but great for workouts.
4	:	I have small ears. They kepf falling out of and off my ears.
4	:	These sound incredible for the price. Only negative is the controls will swing back and forth and hit your neck/face if you try to run or do anything too active. Really easy set up and pairing process.
3	:	Battery life is pretty good. Comfortable. The long press to turn on and off is verrrrrry long. Like annoyingly long.
5	:	"Who knew you could get great sound and functionality at a price that you don???t have to be a professional athlete to afford!  Bass is prominent and tight and mids/highs are well balanced.  The magnetic earpieces are a nice touch and battery life is more than adequate for every day use.  Bravo, Aukey!"
3	:	"Good quality headphones for sound and fit. However, they do NOT activate your Google Assistant / Siri via a button press. This is a dealbreaker, as it does not actively pick up your voice consistently."
5	:	Great for the price. Not the best but way better than any headphone I ever got for around $30. Had an issue and AUKEY was amazing at resolving it.
4	:	"bought as a gift, ended up keeping it for myself. product works but I wish the cord was longer and that the earbud plastic tip remained in place rather than sliding off. sound quality is good, bass heavy, but there seems to be a huge lag (5 seconds+) everytime I try watching a video on my phone or laptop."
5	:	Really good for the price. The sound quality is good and the battery life is great. The only thing I wish it had was better Google assistant support.
5	:	Great earphones for the price. No need to pay more.
2	:	They sound okay they auto connect super quick. But mine have connection problems where they will disconnect at random with my phone near inches away last thing you want in a quiet class room after a exam
5	:	Great earbuds
4	:	"Great sound for the price. Easy to use. This earphones did manage to stay on my ears while riding my road bike, also while working out at the gym, but not while mountain biking.They are worth the price!"
4	:	"The sound is very good & I don???t have as much fall out as I???ve had with other earphones. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get them to stay in, but for the most part they???re good."
5	:	Great sound and connects to cell phone every time.  Battery lasts along time compared to previous brand I was using. Great caring pouch.
5	:	"Great value for the money!  They pair well and work well too.  Cheap enough for 1 pair for home, car and work."
5	:	"Stopped working after one week, emailed customer support and no response. Learned my lesson on cheap headphonesUpdate,They contacted me and sent me a new pair, I love them. I would give a 4.5 for poor customer service but the headphones made up for it"
5	:	"Works great for listening to music/podcasts, and acceptable microphone quality for phone calls. As good as my year-old JBL Reflect Mini BT headset but a quarter the price."
5	:	"These are great active bluetooth headphones, especially for the price. I normally don't prefer this in-ear style of earbud, and I typically go for the unsealed type that's shaped like Apple earpods or Bose earbuds. However, I needed sweatproof earbuds for working out, I didn't want neckbuds, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I figured I'd give these a try and they're actually really comfortable with the smallest eargels and the wings to stabilize them. The earbud piece itself is kind of large, so the wings help keep it from pulling down on your ear. I've mostly just walked and jogged with these in, but they feel pretty secure in my ears. These also sound really good - I'm no audiophile, but I think my music and podcasts sound full and clear on the default equalizer setting. I've had them in windy conditions and didn't notice too much wind noise unless it hits at exactly the right angle. I'm pretty sure the first charge lasted over 8 hours, so battery life seems pretty good. The carrying case is really nice, and my pair also came with a little S-shaped plastic piece to cinch the back of the cord. My only (minor) complaint is that the cover for the charge port is really stiff and doesn't swivel to the side, so it's a little in the way when you plug in a charger. I was a little worried the cover might break, but it seems flexible enough not to break and it snaps back into place after charging so I think it will hold up. The skip forward/backward controls are different from what I'm used to because you long press the volume keys, but it's not hard to remember. Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase."
5	:	The best 25$ bluetooth earbuds you can buy. Don't bother with any others
5	:	"They were a gift, and the recipient loved them. Good for the price."
4	:	"Good headphones. Havent fallen out of my ear when running but feel a little loose, so I have to readjust periodically."
3	:	They fall out of my ears and are weighted too heavily on one side
5	:	"Aukey products always deliver with its great qualities, never fails. Love it! Can???t beat the price either!"
5	:	"I usually have problems with earbuds fitting into my ears correctly, but these fit well and have been tested on a run already. Pairing them with my Apple watch was easy."
5	:	"I don't spend a ton of money on earbuds. The Wirecutter said these were the best wireless earbuds under $50 and I believed them. I haven't tried any of the others but these are the best earbuds, wireless or otherwise, I've ever had."
4	:	"Had some trouble with the ""ear hooks,"" but AUKEY worked it out for me. They kept falling off the earbud, and eventually lost some.Sound quality and battery life are good, actually great for the price point, but the ear hooks require attention if you do a lot of pants or jacket pocket carry."
5	:	I ordered a second pair.  These are great. And hard to lose
5	:	Works for me good
4	:	"The only complaint is I wish that they went a little louder, other than that, they have worked great."
3	:	"These earbuds are great.  They stay in my ear without any movement.  However, after only a month and half one earbud has broken, causing it to fall out of my ear.  I do recommend these, as I???m considering purchasing another pair to replace the broken pair.  I only hope the short life was a fluke."
5	:	Love how long these last. Great sound.
5	:	Very good. Sound and quality are close to more expensive headphone
5	:	Nice looking and very easy to use. I bought this for my wife and she loves it so much. Finally she can enjoy music when jogging on treadmill without worrying about breaking her cell phone. Great stuff!
5	:	Really a quality product. Charger works great. Good sound quality. Very satisfied
5	:	Great headphones! I've used them for running and everyday use. Haven't had any issues with the microphone not being loud enough (or too much background noise) either. Great product for the price!
5	:	"Good sound quality for the price, generally high-quality. One thing I'd love would be if the microphone were a few inches farther down the wire from the earpiece, which would better enable me to cup it against my mouth when talking in noisy environments. But it's a great product."
3	:	"I initially loved these headphones! they worked great and did exactly what I wanted but after about two months of use the left side started to die and battery life lasted a lot less than advertised, disappointed to say the least"
4	:	"Headphones are really good for the price. Sound and bass quality are really good in my opinion, definitly recommend these. I really like the 3 sound modes modes in the these headphones. You wont regret buying these."
4	:	Work well. Easy to set up
5	:	"Perfect fit, i changed the size from medium to small.Sound cancellation surprised me, very comfortable to exercise, and love the magnet that keeps them together!Highly recommended for those used to use the big headphones.(also helpful to keep appearances at work)"
5	:	These are high quality inexpensive headphones well worth the money. The battery is about 6 hours of talk time give or take. I use it for my runs and they never fall out. They play nicely with my iPhone 6splus. Siri works. Just get em
3	:	"I wish I could love these because of how they feel and fit, but on the streets of Manhattan, the sound wasn't good. The podcast kept cutting in and out. When I got to the Park, everything worked fine, but on the road, it wasn't good. Is this normal?"
5	:	This is an amazing pair of bluetooth headphones.
5	:	I'm so glad I found this item after searching for the perfect bluetooth headphones. It fit's in the ear perfectly (comes with 3 sizes) and blocks all surroundings sounds including wind. The voice is very clear and it's a great deal for this price!! Thanks Aukey for making a great product!
3	:	They work ok but are supposed to come with 3 different sized rubber earpieces and mine only came with one and they don???t fit very well.
5	:	These sound surprisingly good for the money. Connecting is easy and they stay in the ear well.
5	:	Had other brands and this one has better overall sound and it could even handle a surprising amount of bass when I was tinkering with the eq app on my phone .
2	:	"I hate these. I only bought them because the EP-B44 model is apparently discontinued, and I figured this would be more of the same. But nope.1. None of the earbud pieces fit my ear.2. The little ear-holder doodles don't fit well, either, and the first time I pulled them out of my t-shirt to put them in, I discovered that they *both* came off, which they do easily, and at any opportunity. Luckily, they happened to fall into a jacket pocket. I'm contemplating supergluing them on.3. Why does it blink? I know you're on. Stop blinking. When I go in to check on my kid, I don't need her asking ""daddy daddy necklace light?""4. Why did the controller switch from right to left? It doesn't matter, but it's different, and I hate it.5. They don't block sound as well as the EP-B44s. I can hear every bit of the stupid conversation people on the train are having.6. I hate these, and secretly hope that a pigeon snatches them out of my ears - which would be easy, because they don't fit - so I can buy a EP-B44 from a reseller.edit: The manufacturer reached out, and offered to send me another pair of EP-B44's, which makes me a very happy customer indeed. I'm going to leave the 2-star review on this product, as I believe it accurately my problems with the product, but I do want to say that I'm very pleased with Aukey in general, and will be leaving a 5-star review on my EP-B44 purchase!"
5	:	I used this headphones for YouTube and phone call. That is great quality. I like that. Just fit what I need
2	:	Cheaply made. When handling the device while it is playing it will cut in and out.
5	:	Awsome very impressed
5	:	Now I can comfortably enjoy music from my phone while working out. I jogged and biked with it. It felt great. The sound is amazing. Great stuff for that kind of money. Love it.
5	:	"They're great,"
1	:	"Stopped working after maybe 10 uses and now won???t turn on. Maybe I just got a faulty one, but not worth the money in my opinion."
5	:	"I didn't think the audio quality was going to be this good on this product just based off the price, but I was very wrong! Pairing is super easy, and the ear pieces fit and stay in the ear very well."
5	:	"These headphones are the truth. Less than $30, Bluetooth, stay in your ear while you run and sound better than the Apple EarPods. I already recommended these to my friends."
5	:	great sound
5	:	These are great! I like them better than the expensive ones that kept falling off my ears. These have way better sound too. Love the fact that they are magnetic!
5	:	"To get the elephant in the room out of the way, a good $30 pair of wired headphones will sound better than these.  That said, for the ($30, shipped via Prime) price, these are GREAT.  They're remarkably compact, and the magnets to hold the earbuds together is a nice touch and work well to keep them organized in their included pouch.  In operation, they've got a real power button, and don't have any hokey built-in voice, just a short melody of beeps to tell you it's turning on/off/you're receiving a call.  I haven't pushed the battery to it's limit yet, so I can't say if it has the advertised 8 hour battery life, but it's easily handled 4 hrs of payback."
4	:	"I just received this product so admittedly it is ""Initial Impressions"" I bought a much more expensive product with a similar style. The one thing I hated about my previous purchase was the chord length between the ear bud pieces. It was not long enough for working out (weight lifting). Shopping around for alternatives, I never notice a product feature is that length from end to end. Others may like the shorter length of something like the X3 or  other models. The other comparison is the chord type. I am sure there is a reason but the flat less flexible chord type is just annoying IMHO. The magnetic earbuds is quite the convenience, I am working out, the simple equalizer modes just makes sense. I find these are great for my types of workout and for the price I am really regretting my Name Brand motivation and purchase but will putting  these through their paces... but these are top notch"
5	:	"Love it! My first wireless headphone experience. I was a bit worried about my constant lack to charge electronics, but these suckers last hours/days. Comfortable and love the magnet."
5	:	"For the price, these are excellent headphones.  They stay in my ears as well as more expensive ones with similar designs.  I have been a jaybird customer for a few years until these and honestly, I prefer these."
5	:	"I have been very happy with the quality, sound and ease of use of these headphones. They are very comfortable and a very nice value purchase for someone on a budget."
5	:	Sound great and feel great!
4	:	Best lower priced wireless headphones I have found.  Been working for a couple months which is more than most have lasted.  Works great walking with my apple watch.  Great for the money.
3	:	Doesn't fit well enough in my ear to eliminate outside noise or deliver bass.
5	:	these are perfect for a first time user.
2	:	Hard to keep in my ear
2	:	These worked great for six weeks. Now they won???t hold a charge. Really disappointing.
5	:	I have 1 set out of the 6 I have ordered that will not except a charge.  These work great otherwise and the price and quality is outstanding.
2	:	"I tried these with four different phones, and in all cases there was a quite noticeable hiss that was distracting and which interfered with listening to my podcasts. I'm returning these and will try other headphones."
5	:	These headphones are very comfortable and easy to use... my wife liked mine so much that I had to buy her a set as well.  The bluetooth set up was simple and is very reliable.
5	:	Edit: Updated reviewStopped working completely after about one month of light use.Aukey contacted me and is sending me a replacement under warranty. Very satisfied.
5	:	Used for gym workouts.  Great quality for the price.
5	:	"For $25 bucks you can???t got wrong.  I???ve had them for about 3 months. They stay paired up too 20 feet, the battery lasts and they sound fine. Not the loudest but who wants to be def. for the money it???s worth it."
5	:	They work great! For the price they are spectacular too!
4	:	"They worked pretty well until the second month, then the left side stopped working out of nowhere."
4	:	"I ordered these headphones after reading a Wirecutter article about their picks for best wireless headphones for working out. I must agree with their pick because these  are pretty darn good. The only downside to them is that the cord bounces annoyingly as you run. I got used to it, however."
5	:	"Really impressed, worth more than I paid."
4	:	"They work great, stay in the ear while jogging, 4 out of 5 cause the sound quality not as great when not positioned perfectly and can irritate ears a bit."
5	:	"These ear buds are amazing!! 3 EQ presets make every listening experience a great one. They're loud enough for the gym, over the noise of the treadmill and machines around me. Lightweight and don't even know they're there. I can't say enough great things about them."
4	:	"I like everything about these.I dislike everything about how I found them, a big ad&review on bgr.com promising the price as $18 with coupon number so and so.Of course, the coupon wasn???t valid, and price was $25. I ordered anyway, but I???m grumpy over those seven bucks"
4	:	"I liked the look and feel, I use them for biking and I wish they were a little lighter. Sound quality is pretty good."
1	:	These headphones are uncomfortable and keep coming out. The cord is not adjustable so the volume controls are just hanging from the side of your head. I should have just paid the extra $$$ for the better headphones.
3	:	"Sound it pretty decent, but could not get them to stay in my or my wife's ears."
4	:	"Im rating these four stars because once you start working out and get sweaty, the earbuds don???t stay in your ear; no matter what size you put on. The volume is adequate but not super loud. Sound quality is about a 4 as well."
4	:	"Sound and work great, the ear pieces sometimes slip however."
5	:	"i bought these on recommendation of Wirecutter, replacing the similar Anker ones i bought last year and recently lost.  They fit better and sound better, so am very happy.  Easy to set up and very happy so fay"
4	:	"I wouldn???t mind a longer lasting battery, but the battery on these wireless headphones is sufficient. Well worth it! Great value and they stay in my ears even when exercising! Occasionally have trouble with phone audio when they are connected to both my phone and my laptop."
5	:	"Just received these headphones in the mail and gave them a try today on the train after my old ones broke (I think panasonic). Pretty great pair of headphones! The sound quality was great, came with extra earpieces just in case if it didn't fit my ear as well. Would highly recommend!"
5	:	"I never write reviews, but I've had such a hard time finding Bluetooth headphones that I like and these are great! Five starsUpdate: buying again after losing my pair. I've tried four or five different pairs in this price range and these are the best."
5	:	"These are fantastic! Great sound, great bass, great range. Worked perfectly at opposite end of the house from my phone. Phone calls are clear and they really cancel out all background noise. Comfortable, and comes with a cute little magnetic bag."
5	:	Good sound and comfortable
5	:	"Amazing buy for less than $30. Easy to use, quick charge, and ear buds stay put when running. Well worth the price"
5	:	My boyfriend and I both have a pair of these and they work very well. I love how my phone can be in one room and I can walk to another room without the audio stopping.
5	:	These earphones work great and I am very happy with them. The charge lasts as described and they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time for listening to Audible books.
5	:	Love these headphones. They pair easily and don't suffer from wind noise when I am riding my bike at speed. Would buy again.
5	:	"Great sound, good fit. So far, so good"
5	:	So far so good.  Got these based on a review from wirecutter.com.  wanted something that stays put in my ear for yardwork-seem to be doing the trick.
4	:	Works great! Easy to set up and use. I do wish the cable was longer so I could reach the controls easier
5	:	"I love it! Easy connection, good quality!"
4	:	"Great quality sound for the price and they stay in well but do slip out when running a bit more easily than hoped. I've changed the ear inserts to fix but to no avail as the larger ones don't fit in my ear size, but they're still a great pair of bluetooth headphones for the price!"
4	:	"Good sound quality and, so far, has held up well against some light roughness. Bought myself a pair and another for backup or gifts. Very good"
5	:	Works and sounds great. Could not see myself spending alot of money. Great purchase.
4	:	"They work great, sound great. Still struggling, however, to get them to stay in my ears while running."
5	:	"Wow, amazing sound quality (for price), super long lasting battery (8-9 hr)"
5	:	great value for money. Sound quality is good. Material quality is decent.
2	:	"These headphones are not as good as the name brand ones. The sound quality, volume, battery life and design don???t work as well. Also having a set of name brand headphones, I keep these as a back up only."
5	:	Good wireless headphones. Works well with my S7 phone. Bike ride to/from work & workout in gym. They stay secured in my ears and provide excellent sound quality &  volume.
3	:	"Sound quality is good, pairing is simple/standard which is good too, but they fall out of my ears very easily.  so it is hard to actually use these for sports/exercise like I intended to use them, but they also just fall out when just walking, turning my head.  I"
5	:	"These are the best Bluetooth headphones I've purchased.  I've tried several other brands from Plantronics to Jabra to Sony.  These fit the best, and sound the best out of all of them."
5	:	"For the price, they're great. Comfortable, decent sound, solid battery life."
5	:	Compact. Like the magnetic earpieces when not using it goes around neck. I???m not an audiophile but sound is just fine for $27. Good choice
5	:	"I read a bunch of reviews like many others no doubt have done. I finally decided on these due to the price and features. I have a IPhone 7 and these do have a power icon when connected to Bluetooth in the top right of the screen. Very nice feature I wasn't expecting. The range is every bit of 30 feet as long as there is no obstructions.Extremely comfortable, and came with everything needed, plus a few extras for customization, to get started other than a charger for the headphones.I haven't had any issues other than punchy base isn't really there. But I wasn't expecting Bose or Beats type of base and audio clarity. I would compare them to JayBirds though. Also, there is no way to figure out what of the 3 sound EQ modes you are on. Both of these aren't deal breakers for me.I would recommend these for the price point. I would also say they are worth more than what they are being sold for."
5	:	"Well worth the money. High quality for only $26, light weight with no big bulky cord or pause button, sound quality is fairly good. You can't match quality and value of it with any major brand of wireless earbuds for that price"
5	:	"Great headphones, buds have a great fit, the sound quality is impeccable, the case it comes in is compact and organized. Charges quickly, has great speakerphone function. VERY HAPPY with the purchase!!! Would recommend 10/10!"
5	:	Amazing sound quality with amazing battery life and a fifth the cost of apple AirPods
5	:	It is very easy and fast pairing with my I phone and tablet. Sound quality is pretty good when I use for music. Microphone is very clear too.
4	:	Wish ia would last a little longer. Great sound and great soft comfort feeling.
2	:	"They buzzed, even at low volume. I returned them."
5	:	I've had these for over a year now and they still work. I put them through several charging cycles a week (probably 3 or 4 fully charged to fully drained).
5	:	Great people to deal with. Exactly as described.
5	:	I???m kind of a headphone snob and these are GREAT for the price point. I???m stoked.
5	:	We love our new Aukey wireless earbuds. This is my first set of wireless buds and they feel great and sound great! Currently ising them with our Peloton bike. Cant beat the price for this quality...
1	:	"Headphones were great for the first few days.  Then unexpectedly heard a lot of static.  Powered unit off and attempted to charge or power on, but headphones no longer responded."
4	:	"Sound is great, Bass reflex is surprisingly good on these headphones"
5	:	"great price, good sound---easy to use. The crazy little blue light can get a little annoying in a dark setting but nothing a little tape can't fix ;)"
5	:	I really like these earbuds.  Sound is good & price is right.  EZ to use.
5	:	Nice and comfortable. sound is very clear.
1	:	"These stopped working after just 2 times using, if you plan on using them and sweating do not get them. The will stop working. When they worked they were good."
5	:	"Very good headphones. Grip is good,sound quality is good for the price and it comes with a great bag and ear plugs to fit ideally."
5	:	Excellent product ???????????????????? can recommend
5	:	"I've been running with these for trips of around 2 hours. I did not charge it once and its usage time was around 5 hours, so I assume it can last even longer. Good for running, doesn't fall out of the ears easily, and feels comfortable to wear!"
1	:	"I liked these headphones...for the 5 weeks that they worked. Now they won???t turn on, charge, anything."
5	:	"These are great bluetooth headphones. The sound quality is great, they were easy to setup, the functionality on the control bar is great and they come with a small bag to store your headphones and charger."
3	:	"Good sound, battery life, and Bluetooth connectivity (easily connects to my Google Pixel 2 or MacBook Pro). But unfortunately the mic is unusable and I can't take calls on it."
4	:	The wireless earbuds are quite good for the price point. The collar-free design is a plus. Easy to pair with devices like PC and Phones. Microphone also performed well at least in indoors.
4	:	"Really nice and easy set up.  Very good sound and noise canceling at gym.  Only downside is the volume control on left side makes it heavy and falls out, but not too much.  Would buy again."
5	:	Worn for running; work great.
5	:	I love using these at the gym while watching Les Mills videos. I don't have to worry about tethering my phone to my body.
3	:	I ended up returning these because they did not fit my ears that well would often slip off while working out.
5	:	can't beat the deal. Decent sound for the price. Comfortable to wear.
2	:	They will not stay in your ears. The cord catches on the sweat of your neck and the ear hooking mechanism isn???t strong enough to keep them in. Buy another pair for 10 more bucks.
4	:	Very pleased for the price. I have small ear openings so I wish the buds came in one size smaller but all in all I???m ver pleased with the product. I like the bass feature of the equalizer.
5	:	none
4	:	"These work fine, but they hurt my ears."
5	:	Great headphones for the money. Wonderful battery life.
5	:	excellent product
4	:	"These are pretty terrific. I've tired other brands in this price range (and lower) and they all felt really cheap, the sound quality akin to a tin can on a string. It was a pain to figure out how to wear them so that outside noise wasn't dominate. Because they have a high profile, when running I literally heard wind whistling over them. Also when walking, I could hear every step taken, and my heartbeat astho my ears were completely plugged. I've never had to futz with a headset more than I had to with these to get a good fit, but so far I'd say its been worth it.Sound quality is great regardless of sound source and for playback of music, podcasts and especially during phone calls. Battery life is impressive, easily pairs with Apple Watch Series3 and iPhone6plus (tho havent been able to get them paired to both at the same time). Onboard controls have been easy to learn and access. Hope they continue to work, I was concerned about the many reviews reporting breakage after 6 or 8 weeks. I expect the charge cover to breakoff, but that kind of stuff isn't necessarily a deal breaker for me. User Instructions were terrific! Thank you very much! Oh, and big added points to Aukey for very nice packaging and providing a storage/carry pouch that's actually usable."
1	:	"cable broke straight away, got a new one. cant connect to bluetooth, phone or mac."
5	:	"These are great wireless headphones! I mostly listen to podcasts when i run, and I can hear great! They stay in your very well. Sometimes the controls on the band can be a little annoying, but I would totally reccomdend these!!"
5	:	Great value. Stellar build quality. Sound is fine for working out. Great battery life. Very happy using these in the gym.
5	:	"Great, beyond my expectations."
4	:	"A little complicated for me to use, initially, and a bit glitchy, but wirefree is AWESOME especially at the gym."
2	:	"It works, but the audio sometimes cuts off when my phone is in my pocket and I'm tryubg to listen to something and they don't feel the best when I'm using them. Don't really like them, but at least they work. 2/5"
2	:	"I love these! I???d probably use them forever. But after two months of use, they just stopped working today.. I didn???t do anything that would cause this. They won???t take a charge."
3	:	Build quality is good but AptX connection cuts in and out during playback.
4	:	Great for the price. I wish the sound quality was a little bit better
5	:	I have 2 pair. I???ve used my first pair for running outside. I used them in all kinds of weather and they are surpringly durable. I have no complaints and I highly recommend them for frequent use if you are very active.
5	:	"Probably best Bluetooth headphones for the price. They are durable, and have great battery life. The distance isn't the best but, chance is you'll have your device on your person which is well within the range. All around amazing product for the price."
5	:	Charges rapidly.  Charge lasts long.  Good sound.  Works well with phone.  Very satisfied.
4	:	"For the price, perfect"
5	:	Great sound for the money.  Key is to make sure you select right size for comfortable fit.
5	:	"Fits in my ear great, sound is excellent and no more connections, who can complain about that."
2	:	"Was really excited after reading so many positive reviews, but was quite disappointed in the sound. The headphones fit fine, seem to hold their charge well and everything... but the sound/audio quality is really poor. Sounds like a tin can and really cheap. I know these are low-cost headphones, but really expected a lot more based on the reviews.Personally I wouldn't be able to recommend these to anyone."
3	:	They were great until two months later when they stopped working. They won???t hold a charge at all.
5	:	"I was not sure if these were what I wanted but, the instructions were simple, easy to follow.  Pairing the device to my music went very well.  Sound is great, fit needs to be played with abit, but very comfortable with all the included sizes."
2	:	"Previously I had the EP-B4 for about 1.5 years, and for what I paid for them they were great. No connection issues, sound was decent. So I decided to stick with Aukey and try the EP-B40s which on paper is better and alleviates some of the issues I had with the EP-B4s (weight, clunkiness, battery life, frustrating rubber seal for charging).Well the EP-B40's are infact better in all those regards. Well worth the very reasonable price and I'd love to be leaving a 4 or 5 star review right now, except for the fact that the bluetooth connection has been nothing but flakey. This seems to happen more when I have my phone in my pocket and am walking, but it happens pretty much every time I do. In a 30 min period (my typical walk to/from work) it'll cut out half a dozen times or so. Each time for maybe a second or so, but long enough for me to notice and feel like I missed something on the podcast or audiobook I might have been listening to.I've tried them with 2 different phones just to be sure and had issues with both. So I have decided to return these and have gone back to the older EP-B4's for now while I try to find a better upgrade."
5	:	nothing to complain so far
3	:	"Not impressed with the sound, moderately secure when running, probably would not buy again."
2	:	"Awful sound. Everything else about these was fine for the price, but I couldn't handle the extremely tinny sound quality. So bad that it hurt my ears even listening to podcasts."
5	:	"Great price, good sound, comes with different size ear pieces that helped make a perfect fit for keeping them in place while running"
5	:	They work great and are very reasonably priced!One request: Print the manual with larger text so it doesn't need a magnifying glass.
5	:	"Amazing sound, super comfortable to wear, long battery life, fast pairing. Basically everything you could want from a set of headphones. You won't go back to regular headphones after getting these - I know I won't."
5	:	"worked well while they lasted, charge lasted longer than other similar products.  Cat thought they were delicious though!"
3	:	"They work, and I never had any connection issues, but the audio quality leaves a lot to be desired."
5	:	Perfect. Cones with a little pouch too. Love it
5	:	"For the price, it's a great product. The sound quality is great. The one downside is sometimes the buds begin to slip out in cardio with a lot of movement."
5	:	Great value for great wireless earphones! Perfect for working out or walking as it doesn???t fall out of your ear. Would definitely purchase again if ever!
1	:	"These headphones do not meet my expectations. They are a waste of money.The volume is low and the EQ modes have very minimal differences. The Bluetooth connection is alright but connecting to multiple devices introduces problems. Other, less expensive headphones, will switch much devices easily and truncate a bad connection rather than play choppy sounds when you get out of range. My old headphones had a lower battery life but the listening experience was much better with them.These headphones do not perform, the sound is just ok, and they are uncomfortable.UPDATE: The mic is also terrible... I used them for a few months mostly for music but I do like to be able to use the mic when I get a call. If the mic is not in the perfect location, or if there is even the slightest bit of surrounding noise, the audio on the other side is the worst... It is frustrating and I will not use these again."
2	:	Difficult to pair. Has stopped working randomly during my workouts. Audio lag while watching videos is TERRIBLE.
5	:	Very good earbuds. Especially for the price.
5	:	Does what it is supposed to do
5	:	love my aukey headphones. the sound is very clear and they are easy to use. I appreciate the little bag to keep them in so I don't loose them in my purse
1	:	I used for a month and then left them alone for a while and now they will not connect to Bluetooth!
4	:	Easy to set up and use. Kinda quiet for my liking.
4	:	"Nice headsets for this cost , only thing is sound doesn???t have much bass even when switching to higher bass equalizer.."
1	:	"I could not get it to work. The device would die as soon as it was unplugged from the charger. I could only to turn it on while it was charging, but it made a constant screeching sound when I did that."
5	:	"Great headphones for the price, and in general. My son loves them."
5	:	These things actually work. Even my aging hard of hearing pals can understand my phone calls.Music listening quality quite acceptable.
4	:	I love these and they're almost perfect. The only issue is how loud your own voice sounds with these is. I'm not sure how but it's a bit much.
5	:	"These headphones sound good, especially for the price.  I would buy them again."
2	:	"The sound is clear but there is not enough bass. I've had Bose and B&O to compare and yes they are a lot more $$$ but I like listening to classic rock music, so it's worth it to me."
5	:	"The sound is amazing for something so inexpensive, they are easy to pair with multiple devices, and they are comfortable to wear."
5	:	Incredible product for the money. Comes with a variety of ear bud sizes to find your perfect fit. Can't beat this for the money!
5	:	Very nice headphones.  Great sound and long battery life.  The volume button on the left side earbud bounces around when running which can be annoying but can't really complain for this price and still feels light.
4	:	"Reasonably priced, good sound. Storage pouch is handier than most."
1	:	Left earphone stopped working after minimal use.  Haven???t tried to contact seller yet to return. Will update.
5	:	"Best value for you dollar, hands down! I'm on my 3rd pair, I lost the first two, and still have paid less than a pair of beats. Love the ear brace, they stay in when I'm working out."
2	:	Mic is too sensitive. Picks up too many background sounds.
5	:	Earbuds work great! They fit perfectly and connection is stable. Sound is decent and they are comfortable to wear.
4	:	Sound is good. Fit is good.  Price was good.  Should have bought these a long time ago.
4	:	"Good product. Works well most of the times.  The signal does occasionally break up, but never while moving around, it's odd. I use them to run, they are great."
1	:	Trash. Don???t stay in your ear at all. They fall out at least 10x a workout. All the positive reviews on here must be fake.
2	:	Very disappointed about purchasing this headphones after all the good reviews I seen everywhere about this headphone. They fit well and everything but very poor sound quality.
4	:	"Sound: good top end and ok mids, would like a fatter bottom end sound, but for the price it'll doEasy to pair to iphoneOverall good for the price"
1	:	Magnet isn't strong enough to keep the buds together while in use. Right ear bud sound is gone. Was looking forward to these based on reviews
1	:	Loved it for the time it worked.  Product died on me in 4 months.  Would not turn on. Would not charge.  Just died.
1	:	They melted while charging ..... smelled burning plastic and look what I found. Highly dissastisfied
5	:	great acoustics
2	:	Ear buds just stopped working after 3 weeks.sound quality was good though.tried charging it as per the manual but lights woudnt come on.very poor qualitywould not recommend
1	:	The damned things stopped charging in under 2 weeks. That???s 2 charges.I would recommend not buying these.
1	:	broke after a few days
5	:	My third AUKEY product (wireless doorbell and car charger) and impressed again. Good build and good prices
5	:	Been using these earbuds for 8 months and have had zero issues to date! Battery is suberb with an amazingly long life. Would recommend to all my friends and family!
5	:	Works well! Microphone is good too!
4	:	"Perfect earbuds for the right price. They are not high end but for wireless headphones under $30, I cant find a better alternative."
4	:	Would have liked the buttons to be colored but the headphones work as advertized.
1	:	It worked well for 8 days (about 3 charge cycles); then stopped. The seller is not responsive to replacing it.
5	:	Last very long and charge very quick. Audio is very crisp for wireless earbuds. You definitely get more than what you paid for value wise.
5	:	Great value for money. They do everything the instruction booklet says it will do.
5	:	"I LOVE theses headphones especially for the price. Great sound, they don't fall out of your ears while running and have a good battery life!"
5	:	"Easy set up, good design"
5	:	One of the best gifts my son says he has gotten in a long time. The sound quality is amazing.
5	:	Love em awesome pair of buds work great easy to use and sound dope great value for their price
4	:	"Excelent product. Good sound, easy setup"
1	:	"a piece of garbage, doesn't stay connected at all. if you have an iphone don't get this"
5	:	Good quality.  Paired with my new apple watch and also my phone.  Great price compared to other Apple watch headphones.
1	:	Stopped connecting to bluetooth after 4 month.  If I could give it zero stars I would/
1	:	Would not turn on even after full night of charging. Also would not stay connected via bluetooth
5	:	"a workout staple, much more durable and high quality than expected"
4	:	"UPDATE: 04/30/2018So Aukey contacted me and sent a new pair. These ended up working out much better. I hadn't had a chance to test them out until recently. There still was some break ups in the connection, but it wasn't as bad as before. I even went 5 days without charging them, and they seemed to still be good to go. So if you have any real problems, Aukey was quick to try to resolve it.Original review:I had high hopes for these wireless earbuds. I had read a few reviews, and they were all good. Unfortunately, they did not live up to the hype.I have these connected with my Google Pixel XL phone. Sitting at my desk, they seem fine. Bass can get really muddy and distorted. Though, I don't expect much. They sound just as good as my $10 wired samsung earbuds I have. Honestly, that's all I needed them to do.Then I went for a walk. I hold the phone in my hand, because I play Pokemon Go while I walk. If I was swinging my arms as I walked, it seemed like there was a lot of cutting out. It was like a skipping record. If I slowed down the arm swing, or tried holding the phone up, the connected seemed better, but would still cut out. Eventually I found a happy medium, and was mostly pleased the first day.Then today I went out for another walk. They were complete garbage. No matter where or how my phone was held, it was cutting out for at least the first 10 to 15 minutes of my walk. They did start playing sort of ok, but the entire walk was filled with skipping audio. It is bad enough that I had to come home to write this review, and I am going to request a refund.Fit wise, they were fine with the default tips, and I thought they felt comfortable. I just can't handle this poor of performance out of headphones, no matter what the price."
5	:	Sound great
5	:	These sound great and are easy to use.
5	:	Sound and battery life is good. Had some trouble getting them to fit but was able to get  it to work and they stay in place now.
3	:	These seem like they are probably alright but I couldn't pair with my S5 so sadly they will be returned.
2	:	"I found these on a top ten list somewhere and tried them out. As I read in the review for them, the sound is very good for the price category. However, big issue with the design.The controller hangs just a few inches from the ear and it has some weight to it, enough that it is constantly swinging and tugging at the earpiece when you move. I tried all the combinations of the ear inserts and little retainers, but none were sufficient to hold the earpiece in place during even minor activity (yoga, for instance).Sound-wise, these are good little wireless phones if you're not planning to move much. But I would not recommend for exercise or even walking around.I'm gonna try to find a pair that matches this kind of sound quality with an over-the-ear retaining system."
5	:	Great sound and long battery life.
5	:	Great headphones for the price.
3	:	"Solid headphones for a good price, but after two months of use, the left ear bud is significantly quieter than the right."
5	:	Love them. Use them regularly at work.
1	:	They were great until they stopped pairing! Want a refund or new pair!
1	:	Disappointed half the time I can???t get them to turn on even tho they are charged
5	:	"These are amazing, most earbuds slip from my ear, these stay put through any workout!"
5	:	I love these headphones great fit in the ear and great sound. The only thing that I hate about them is the blue light that turns on every 8 seconds.
5	:	For 27 dollars these sound amazing good highs good lows highly recomend
2	:	Does not work with Apple?
5	:	Small. Compact. Long lasting battery life. Comfortable fit.
4	:	Adjusting the volume is difficult using the buttons on the earphone control.  Otherwise the earphones work as advertised.
5	:	Great product! Actually paired / synched with my Apple Iwatch 3 with no problems!! Great buy!
5	:	I would recommend
5	:	These last for so long and don't take long to charge and love this brand and at a great price :)
4	:	Sound similar to beats. High in bass. Pretty good quality sound and fits well.
5	:	"Good sound quality, lightweight. Very easy to pair and unpair with the phone."
1	:	"Unfortunately not great sound, bought two for kiddos . One came with no sound in left ear .. would not buy again"
5	:	I love these. They fit on my ear perfectly and have good sound.
5	:	Really great value for the price - fits well in my ear and pairs almost instantaneously with my phone.  Easy to use and good quality volume.
2	:	First and foremost I am not in any way associated with Anker or were given any headphones for free in any way. Period. The reason I write this is because I bought red Anker Slim's and wanted black but read people's reviews of the superior Aukley but they were very wrong. I also hate that the Aukley came with one bud compared to Ankers 3 sizes. The Aukley build quality is fine and the battery life as well but no bass and I'm not a bass head but they have that sound like you are listening the music but played down the hall. The sound doesn't have a full body and it more treble than I would like. Not happy sub par sound on great build quality. And Volume wise they do not compare to the Anker Slim's sadly.
4	:	These headphones are so comfortable and don't hurt my ears like most do.
5	:	Last a long time. Clear sound. Good controls. Fit OK.
4	:	"very happy buds took some get use to sometimes slip out a little when I run, but great product"
1	:	poor life expectancy for price of the product
4	:	"I really like these headphones, good design, work as expected, and they have a good battery life."
5	:	Accidentally washed these right after the first use and they still work great!
5	:	"The earbuds work great and sound great! These are truly worth it, especially at their price point."
5	:	"Absolutely perfect for what I needed. Great for working out because they don't fall out of my ears, the charge is more than enough, and they are comfortable."
5	:	Great earbuds for the money.  Like them better than my beats which cost 5X as much
4	:	The headphones have great sound and paired up easy.
3	:	The sound quality is OK.
4	:	"Nice sound, wish the controls were further away from the earpiece."
4	:	I love these headset
2	:	returned product after trying. bluetooth connection spotty.
5	:	"Awesome quality and functionality! Easy to set up, too."
4	:	Great product. The cord tends to end up on the side where the control is located. Sounds and functions great.
5	:	"Got this today, they are amazing. The sound quality is nice with the given price. Definitely a great product by Aukey."
5	:	Love it.  Works great
5	:	Great Headphones Check them out on YouTube Plenty of videos that have Great reviews on them that why i got them Vary Happy!!
5	:	Good fit...and a nice variety of ear buds and wingtips.
5	:	The sound quality on this thing is actually surprising. Works very well.
4	:	It is really good but wish id taken the care plan! Would recommend it to anyone for work outs
5	:	"Great sound, long lasting battery and comfortable! Well worth the money!"
5	:	Work great!
2	:	i don't like it its falling from my ear
5	:	as expected
1	:	No power after 3 months of using. Very bad quality
5	:	The sound from these headphones is fantastic.  Love it.
5	:	sound good
3	:	Versatility. They are compact with a great sound. Battery life is very short
5	:	Great Bluetooth headphones
5	:	"Love them! Quality product, great sound. Service and delivery A1"
5	:	Really good quality
4	:	Works as advertised.  Love it.
5	:	Love these wireless headphones... Got them with me all the time.
5	:	It fits my ear perfectly without falling out while I work out. Nice wireless ear plug.
3	:	doesn't stay in ear with any kind of movement.  I might not have the right combination of ear plugs
1	:	They stopped working after only 6 months!
4	:	Work great but was unable to register Warrenty on line.
5	:	Works great so far.
3	:	Comfortable and sound good for the price. Oddly distorts audio when on phone calls though which is a shame
5	:	These wireless headphones sound like they cost 150 bucks i am happy with these.
1	:	These wouldn???t connect to any device I tried. Waste of money. Did not work with iPhone 7. I got it to use with an Apple Watch that I haven???t received yet and I don???t think I???m going to wait around and see if these work cause they probably won???t! Oh and I messaged the retailer (aukey) and they never responded. Horrible!
5	:	These are wonderful.
3	:	Okay for its price.
2	:	Need to keep charging often. The ear bud does not fit right and keep coming off.  Sound quality is not the best
5	:	Work well sound great and microphone works well for calls
2	:	Keeps cutting out during calls. Literally the one thing I need these to do....
5	:	Love this set of earbuds-very comfortable in the ears and great sound
1	:	"Poor volume, battery and very uncomfortable"
5	:	The magnets are life savers
5	:	Great bluetooth headphones! For the price you can't go wrong!
2	:	"These headphones sound OK for the price however;1. They're pretty heavy, there is definitely too much weight and bulk in each earbud for long-term comfortable use. After 30 minutes of using these headphones, I find them to be really annoying to wear.2. The battery life is BRUTAL. I only get about 4 hours of use out of them. Charging my headphones everyday isn't exactly something I'm thrilled about doing.3. Also, why does holding down the middle button not activate siri? This seems like a simple thing to figure out in terms of design..."
5	:	"For the price, AWESOME!"
4	:	"Great sound, and battery life. Also very comfortable."
5	:	High quality ans baterry life duration.
1	:	unable to pair with windows 7 only
3	:	"/** PROS **/- The best customer service I have had over any other product.- I love the fact if you double press the center button you can change from Balanced to Treble to Extra Bass modes.- Very easy to use, and even shows battery percentage on my Google Pixel.- Comes with a very sleek carrying pouch which is awesome.- The backs of the headphones are magnetic, so you can clasp them together to tuck them away quite nicely.- The charging is really, really fast. It charges in around and hour and a half./** CONS **/- The cable that they give you to charge it is really, really crappy. Probably one of the worst cables i've seen given to charge this up.- If you don't normally wear headphone hooks like I do, it can get uncomfortable wearing them and you have to take them out every once in awhile.- The headphones use micro USB to charge, which isn't bad, yet from past experience the port can break. The Jaybird's solution to charging is wayyy better than this one.- Sometimes with my Google Pixel I loose bluetooth connection for whatever reason (which seems to happen with these headphones), yet this seems to happen on a lot of my devices, so i'm not really concerned about this part.- I did have issues switching sound modes one time when the redial mode ended up turning on instead which was annoying./**Overall**/These aren't going to kill the Jaybird X3's anytime soon, yet they are very solid for people on a budget. I will be updating my review soon once I break these in a little more. You should also get these if you want solid customer service and a really amazing reputation."
1	:	Left earbud didn???t work upon opening.
